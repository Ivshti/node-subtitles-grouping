HELLO PEOPLE!

2
00:00:10,785 --> 00:00:15,785
~ Dexter S04E01 ~
~ "Living the Dream" ~

3
00:00:20,886 --> 00:00:25,886
:)

5
00:01:47,186 --> 00:01:48,745
Previously on Dexter...

6
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:50,874
That's for sure, I'm pregnant.

7
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:53,988
<i>What kind of father would I be?</i>

8
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,055
<i>After all, I kill people.</i>

9
00:01:58,365 --> 00:02:01,295
<i>Me, demented daddy Dexter.</i>

10
00:02:02,574 --> 00:02:06,671
This child is happening.
But your role in its live is entirely up to you.

11
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,379
Yesterday morning you said,
when the case ends, we end.

12
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,316
I thought you understood
when we got involved.

13
00:02:12,534 --> 00:02:14,129
I track killers, that's what I do.

14
00:02:14,272 --> 00:02:16,327
A pattern of bodies
was identified in Oregon.

15
00:02:16,328 --> 00:02:17,295
My flight leaves tonight.

16
00:02:17,396 --> 00:02:19,507
If you're leaving,
we got to work out logistics.

17
00:02:19,508 --> 00:02:21,010
Do you honestly
want to go down this path?

18
00:02:22,512 --> 00:02:24,861
I don't know if I'm gonna
be a father to the kid.

19
00:02:24,966 --> 00:02:27,414
How could you even say
you're not gonna be a father to that kid?

20
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:29,380
I mean, where would
you be without Harry?

21
00:02:29,855 --> 00:02:32,972
<i>Harry knew my mother.
Laura Moser was his informant.</i>

22
00:02:33,165 --> 00:02:36,280
<i>Was he just using her?
Was he using me?</i>

23
00:02:36,832 --> 00:02:38,189
Dad wasn't perfect, Deb.

24
00:02:38,383 --> 00:02:40,609
What did he do?
Did he cheat on mom?

25
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:42,308
Bullshit! Who?

26
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:45,539
I need all the records you have
on my dads confidential informants.

27
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,730
Track the female CIs.

28
00:02:47,755 --> 00:02:49,148
Why? You know something?

29
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:51,632
There's a good reason why
Quinn's of interest to Internal Affairs.

30
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:54,721
Internal Affairs was investigating you.
Is there something you're not telling us?

31
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:57,156
- Anton's not officially CI.
- What do you mean?

32
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:59,301
I never filed an arrest report on him.

33
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:01,492
You are the best thing
that has happened to me.

34
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,028
Just sending out my
positive intentions to our baby.

35
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:09,100
Rita, we're connected.
You're what makes me real.

36
00:03:09,236 --> 00:03:12,528
- Please, say yes.
- Yes, we will mary you.

37
00:03:13,414 --> 00:03:15,670
Sylvia has offered to list my house,...

38
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,178
so we can buy something bigger.

39
00:03:18,343 --> 00:03:21,171
Better hope she doesn't insist
on a place with central air.

40
00:03:21,524 --> 00:03:23,547
I was actually thinking
I might keep my place.

41
00:03:23,683 --> 00:03:26,070
"No" doesn't really work
in a relationship, Dexter.

42
00:03:26,224 --> 00:03:28,667
Every man needs his privacy.
Some more than others.

43
00:03:29,832 --> 00:03:31,927
<i>Is it possible
I had actually made a friend?</i>

44
00:03:32,057 --> 00:03:34,318
<i>Someone I can trust
with my dark secrets?</i>

45
00:03:34,324 --> 00:03:37,200
I didn't teach you the code
to share with your buddies.

46
00:03:37,303 --> 00:03:40,399
<i>Miguel really did it
and I taught him how.</i>

47
00:03:40,552 --> 00:03:43,485
<i>Harry was right.
He used me.</i>

48
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,570
You're all just
unshaved versions of myself.

49
00:03:46,766 --> 00:03:48,891
What I would have become
without my fathers code.

50
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:53,660
I could kill you now.

51
00:03:53,903 --> 00:03:55,272
I've never felt this.

52
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:58,761
You've never had a son before.
You want to see him come into the world.

53
00:03:58,762 --> 00:04:01,798
Yes. I never wanted
anything so much in my live.

54
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:09,586
<i>I have moved on from my father.
But I still need his code.</i>

55
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:12,498
<i>Up right now, live is good.</i>

56
00:04:12,974 --> 00:04:15,799
<i>Dexter Morgan, family man.</i>

57
00:04:40,234 --> 00:04:41,727
<i>Tonight's the night.</i>

58
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,388
<i>The night when a
primal sacred need calls to me.</i>

59
00:04:49,602 --> 00:04:50,978
<i>I've waited...</i>

60
00:04:51,316 --> 00:04:52,782
<i>and waited,...</i>

61
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,009
<i>but tonight,...</i>

62
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:55,779
<i>this night,...</i>

63
00:04:58,535 --> 00:04:59,869
<i>it's time.</i>

64
00:05:28,215 --> 00:05:30,219
<i>Tonight's the night I finally...</i>

65
00:05:31,614 --> 00:05:32,829
<i>sleep.</i>

66
00:06:28,682 --> 00:06:29,919
Oh my God! No!

67
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:40,190
Okay, Harrison.

68
00:06:40,305 --> 00:06:43,560
The driving thing didn't work.
The singing thing didn't work.

69
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:47,761
You planning on both of us
not sleeping for another three month?

70
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:50,400
Apparently so.

71
00:06:52,655 --> 00:06:55,799
Okay, I want to take you inside,
but I don't want you waking mommy.

72
00:06:57,073 --> 00:06:58,069
Hey!

73
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,999
If you could talk you'd tell me
not to worry about you, right?

74
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:07,287
No!

75
00:07:08,922 --> 00:07:09,869
Please!

76
00:07:17,424 --> 00:07:18,819
Please!

77
00:07:26,672 --> 00:07:27,970
It's already over.

78
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:51,079
Marco?

79
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:52,372
Polo!

80
00:08:52,643 --> 00:08:53,880
Marco?

81
00:08:54,374 --> 00:08:55,579
Polo!

82
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:02,879
<i>There's this cliché, where serial killers are
always described as quiet, kept to themself,...</i>

83
00:09:03,018 --> 00:09:04,079
<i>kind of a loner.</i>

84
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:08,518
<i>And it's a cliché for a reason.</i>

85
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:12,201
Has anybody seen my keys?

86
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:14,800
Astor, I asked you to keep it down.

87
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:19,450
Why do you hate my music so much?

88
00:09:19,451 --> 00:09:21,060
No, I don't hate your music.

89
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:22,343
You don't?

90
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:25,761
Cody, get the hell out of this pool!
It's time for school!

91
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:28,391
If I had an iPod you wouldn't
have to listen to my stuff.

92
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:30,491
You want an iPod, earn one.

93
00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:33,741
- Do your chores, unplug your Metal.
- Mom, you're so unfair!

94
00:09:38,814 --> 00:09:39,819
Did you get any sleep?

95
00:09:40,574 --> 00:09:42,420
An hour and a half maybe.

96
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:46,032
You've court. Look, I appreciate
that you're in the night shift.

97
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:49,148
But when you have a big day like today,
it's okay to wake me up.

98
00:09:49,696 --> 00:09:52,131
Well, it's kinda on the
job training, you know.

99
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:54,792
All that matters is
his father's there for him.

100
00:09:55,234 --> 00:09:57,745
- I cannot find the keys.
- Cody!

101
00:09:58,393 --> 00:09:59,633
Astor, the music!

102
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:01,700
You usually let them
lie here by the phone.

103
00:10:01,754 --> 00:10:02,571
I know.

104
00:10:04,014 --> 00:10:06,142
- School, clothes, now.
- Sorry.

105
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:13,437
If you don't get some sleep, it won't be
your keys that get lost. Rather your mind.

106
00:10:13,937 --> 00:10:15,441
I lost it eight years ago.

107
00:10:30,117 --> 00:10:31,413
<i>Dexter Morgan,...</i>

108
00:10:31,538 --> 00:10:33,148
<i>good suburban husband,...</i>

109
00:10:33,345 --> 00:10:35,122
<i>happy father of three...</i>

110
00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:37,814
<i>On paper anyway.</i>

111
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:41,141
Hey, Dex!
What's the news?

112
00:10:41,826 --> 00:10:43,245
Too soon to tell.

113
00:10:44,121 --> 00:10:46,629
Dexter!
Dex, you forgot your cellphone.

114
00:10:48,671 --> 00:10:49,918
Good morning, Elliot!

115
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:51,997
That's a beautiful day.

116
00:10:52,032 --> 00:10:53,542
More pool time for the kids.

117
00:10:53,597 --> 00:10:56,922
You already took the morning shift,
so I'll watch them this afternoon.

118
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,860
Takes a village.

119
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:11,009
Carpools and swimming pools...

120
00:11:11,427 --> 00:11:13,739
How much are we living the dream?

121
00:11:14,552 --> 00:11:16,680
So much.

122
00:11:18,526 --> 00:11:20,432
<i>Living the dream...</i>

123
00:11:28,884 --> 00:11:33,172
Hey, um... do you think
you can tivo John Steward for me?

124
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,302
You're thinking about John Steward?

125
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:44,100
Well, he is handsome... and funny.

126
00:11:44,888 --> 00:11:46,230
I love you.

127
00:11:52,454 --> 00:11:53,860
Motherfuck me.

128
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:56,127
Well, that's kinda
where this is heading.

129
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:58,331
No, I'm late for work.

130
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:08,513
It's a good thing
you moved down or I'd never see you.

131
00:12:08,514 --> 00:12:10,449
Well, one of us has to live here.

132
00:12:10,643 --> 00:12:13,403
At least with the crew ship
I get to see you every few days.

133
00:12:14,606 --> 00:12:15,708
I went on tour.

134
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,492
I know.

135
00:12:16,614 --> 00:12:18,141
It's okay, I kinda like it.

136
00:12:18,326 --> 00:12:19,879
Keeps you from getting sick of me.

137
00:12:20,314 --> 00:12:23,397
- That's never gonna happen.
- Yeah, because you're never here.

138
00:12:23,398 --> 00:12:26,581
No, because you make me happy.

139
00:12:31,956 --> 00:12:34,908
And what conclusions did you draw
from the blood evidence, Mr. Morgan?

140
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:38,818
I was able to determine
the victims movement and direction...

141
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:43,932
after the initial blunt force trauma
to the head caused by the defendants fist.

142
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:45,288
How so?

143
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:46,550
I...

144
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:49,209
reconstructed... err...

145
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:53,850
timeline and sequence
of events by examining...

146
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,158
It's here somewhere.

147
00:12:56,627 --> 00:12:59,934
I noticed a passive
flow patterned blood stain,...

148
00:12:59,935 --> 00:13:02,171
approximately 2 meters in length,...

149
00:13:02,196 --> 00:13:03,969
emanating from the head wound...

150
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,679
and the sample was consistent with
the sample from the defendant's shirt.

151
00:13:09,384 --> 00:13:12,246
You did say
"passive flow patterned blood stain".

152
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:14,167
Quote on quote.

153
00:13:14,206 --> 00:13:15,980
What exactly do your notes say?

154
00:13:19,388 --> 00:13:24,825
The blood stain described a passive pooling
and flow configuration type 0-negative,...

155
00:13:25,047 --> 00:13:27,781
matching the sample taken from...

156
00:13:30,538 --> 00:13:34,192
Leon Etti's... shirt.

157
00:13:36,254 --> 00:13:38,133
But this is the Gomez hearing.

158
00:13:38,345 --> 00:13:42,238
Yes, Mr. Morgan.
The defendant's name is Benito Gomez.

159
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:44,817
I must have brought the wrong notes.

160
00:13:44,968 --> 00:13:49,399
Do you frequently become confused and disoriented
while conducting your spatter analysis, Mr. Morgan?

161
00:13:49,434 --> 00:13:54,994
No, I do not. We just had a new baby.
Things were a little hectic this morning.

162
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:57,498
So you're saying that you're sleep-deprived
and that it's effecting your judgement?

163
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,235
No, it's just a momentary mixup.

164
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:03,739
Wrong notes, wrong blood type,
wrong defendant, wrong case,...

165
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:07,170
That's what you call a
momentary mixup in a murder trial?

166
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,569
I misspoke.

167
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:11,220
- Fuck it!
- Your honor, the witness has just...

168
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:13,704
demonstrated how unreliable
he is in a court room.

169
00:14:13,754 --> 00:14:16,830
I would have to ask how
reliable his work is in the lab...

170
00:14:16,865 --> 00:14:20,596
or on a crime scene. Moreover,
how reliable is a police department,...

171
00:14:20,597 --> 00:14:23,889
that they would place so much
trust in his expert opinion.

172
00:14:32,254 --> 00:14:34,961
I'm halfway through
the CI-files you gave me.

173
00:14:35,153 --> 00:14:36,230
If I were you,...

174
00:14:36,355 --> 00:14:38,451
I'd spend more time
with that man of yours...

175
00:14:38,584 --> 00:14:44,070
and less time looking for some old CI
your daddy might've diddled back in the day.

176
00:14:44,302 --> 00:14:46,081
I meet another one tomorrow.

177
00:14:46,682 --> 00:14:48,458
Maybe then I'll finally
get some answers.

178
00:14:48,744 --> 00:14:51,139
Say, you do, then what?

179
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,652
Then I'll know,...

180
00:14:56,023 --> 00:14:59,591
that my perfect fucking father
wasn't so fucking perfect.

181
00:14:59,877 --> 00:15:02,297
So that's what?
The meaning of live?

182
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,672
The meaning of my live.

183
00:15:09,895 --> 00:15:11,060
Hey, buddy.

184
00:15:12,114 --> 00:15:13,467
Guess where I was yesterday.

185
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:17,182
- Well, I'm not sure...
- I visited a store.

186
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:18,757
Wanna take guess what kind of store?

187
00:15:18,816 --> 00:15:21,319
- I don't know. Grocery?
- Clothing.

188
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:25,061
You know me, I'm pretty into that shit.
Got to come correct, you know. But not yesterday.

189
00:15:25,062 --> 00:15:27,212
- Look, if this is about...
- Come on, buddy. Let me finish.

190
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:30,814
I was at a store helping a lady to
pick out a suit for her son. Know why?

191
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:33,739
Cause he had to be in court,
see the guy who killed his old man.

192
00:15:33,744 --> 00:15:35,953
Kid's first fucking suit.

193
00:15:35,988 --> 00:15:37,540
Something a father should be doing.

194
00:15:37,575 --> 00:15:39,079
- I'm sorry.
- Little late for sorry.

195
00:15:39,114 --> 00:15:42,250
- That asshole you let walk...
- Benito Gomez.

196
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:44,561
Ah! Now you get it right.

197
00:15:44,596 --> 00:15:46,527
Did you actually see
what that fuckhead did?

198
00:15:46,744 --> 00:15:52,659
Gomez hit the kid's old man so hard his cheekbone
broke, pushing his eyeball up and out of his face.

199
00:15:52,694 --> 00:15:55,633
Then Gomez, sweetheat that he is,
kills the guy in front of his own son.

200
00:15:55,824 --> 00:15:56,903
- I know.
- How about this beauty?

201
00:15:56,904 --> 00:16:01,214
Gomez did five years for beating his girlfriend so
bad even her dentist had a hard time with the ID.

202
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:03,252
So is your "Sorry"
gonna keep Gomez from...

203
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:06,037
- pummeling somebody else into Dex's world?
- Jesus, chill out, Quinn!

204
00:16:06,126 --> 00:16:08,017
No, Deb, he's right.

205
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:10,859
I screwed up in court today.
Gomez walked. This one's on me.

206
00:16:10,864 --> 00:16:13,833
Thanks. That means so much.
Why don't you hold on to this for me, ok, buddy?

207
00:16:13,868 --> 00:16:15,629
I'm sick of looking at him.

208
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,771
You screwed up?

209
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:19,100
Big time.

210
00:16:20,196 --> 00:16:21,812
Should I be worried?

211
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,834
No, I'll be okay.

212
00:16:26,715 --> 00:16:29,692
Maybe it's Benny Gomez
who should be worried.

213
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:33,507
And good solve on
the Reynolds case, guys.

214
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:36,131
Next up, chief's office wants...

215
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:39,261
Anything I can do to keep that
angry Irish off your ass, let me know.

216
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:42,183
You're a real friend, Vince.

217
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:47,270
Quinn is a good cop.
I need a good kill.

218
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:50,713
And sometimes one
just falls into your lap.

219
00:16:55,038 --> 00:16:58,446
We got a body in Kendall.
Morgan, Quinn, you're up.

220
00:16:58,481 --> 00:17:01,268
And Dexter, there's blood.
Lots of blood.

221
00:17:10,024 --> 00:17:11,639
Talk about your blood bath.

222
00:17:15,136 --> 00:17:16,293
Tough room.

223
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:19,658
Okay, femoral artery severed.
She bled out in minutes.

224
00:17:19,765 --> 00:17:21,741
- Suicide?
- No weapon on the premises.

225
00:17:21,795 --> 00:17:25,494
Exactly. The coroner can suck my uncircumsized
dick if he doesn't rule this as a homicide.

226
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:27,380
It's way too much information, Masuka.

227
00:17:27,465 --> 00:17:30,201
Employment ?records? show
she just got promoted to sous-chef.

228
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:34,718
A total babe... and she could cook.
Had it all going on.

229
00:17:34,936 --> 00:17:36,034
Then this.

230
00:17:36,035 --> 00:17:37,904
It's a very well organized crime scene.

231
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:40,102
The assailant took his time,...

232
00:17:41,915 --> 00:17:43,982
cleaned up after himself.

233
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,027
<i>Obviously doesn't have kids.</i>

234
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:49,554
Keep an eye on our expert witness.
In case our girl's parents...

235
00:17:49,555 --> 00:17:52,601
actually want to see someone go
to jail for doing this to their daughter.

236
00:17:55,655 --> 00:17:56,641
Harsh.

237
00:18:03,655 --> 00:18:06,362
Christine Hill,
Florida Journal Dispatch.

238
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,273
And?

239
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:09,763
And was Miss Bell the only victim?

240
00:18:11,165 --> 00:18:12,186
Who gave you her name?

241
00:18:12,468 --> 00:18:15,500
I searched the address
on this thing called the internet.

242
00:18:16,256 --> 00:18:17,841
What can you tell me
about the murderer?

243
00:18:18,026 --> 00:18:19,180
Suspects?

244
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:20,882
Murder? Suspects?

245
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:23,231
We still haven't
officially ruled out suicide.

246
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:24,870
So it's pills?

247
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:26,103
No.

248
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:28,788
Then she bled out.

249
00:18:28,837 --> 00:18:30,959
Women pretty much
only do one or the other.

250
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:34,202
Do me a favor, if you break
this case before we do, give me a call.

251
00:18:35,236 --> 00:18:37,504
It's Detective Joseph Quinn.

252
00:18:37,613 --> 00:18:40,967
Miami Metro, extension 3734.

253
00:18:44,295 --> 00:18:45,561
Cell number?

254
00:18:46,276 --> 00:18:47,988
Nice touch, Joseph.

255
00:19:02,897 --> 00:19:04,021
Damnit!

256
00:19:04,216 --> 00:19:06,302
Can anyone fill up the...

257
00:19:06,376 --> 00:19:09,161
fucking... water thing?

258
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,519
- Tough crime scene?
- No.

259
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:16,702
I know of nothing.

260
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:19,716
Yes.

261
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:24,751
You know, when things are going good,
I think that's God's way of saying...

262
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:27,686
to cover your ass because
something is gonna jump up and bite it.

263
00:19:27,687 --> 00:19:28,620
Hard.

264
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,387
Well put.

265
00:19:30,756 --> 00:19:32,401
You and Anton are doing okay?

266
00:19:33,035 --> 00:19:33,984
Like on what?

267
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:36,013
Any sign your ass is gonna get bit?

268
00:19:36,278 --> 00:19:37,230
None.

269
00:19:37,265 --> 00:19:39,251
So this is you
just making yourself crazy?

270
00:19:39,497 --> 00:19:41,017
That's kind of what I do.

271
00:19:43,678 --> 00:19:44,521
What?

272
00:19:44,593 --> 00:19:46,991
It's just that I've taken
that trip a thousand times before.

273
00:19:47,128 --> 00:19:49,642
- And?
- And knock it off.

274
00:19:50,036 --> 00:19:51,798
Is that an order, boss?

275
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:56,112
Just some free advice from
someone who has been there before.

276
00:19:57,516 --> 00:20:00,549
Hey, did you ever go out with
that guy that Anton wanted you to meet?

277
00:20:01,973 --> 00:20:04,149
Musicians, not really my dream.

278
00:20:04,305 --> 00:20:06,007
He owns a restaurant.

279
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:08,382
Three of them.
Cuban restaurants.

280
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:10,865
What the fuck is wrong with musicians?

281
00:20:11,178 --> 00:20:12,630
That came out wrong.

282
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:15,462
What makes you think
a Cuban restaurant matters?

283
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,388
That came out wrong too.

284
00:20:19,036 --> 00:20:21,498
I'm not looking for anyone new anyway.

285
00:20:21,603 --> 00:20:23,539
But when and if...

286
00:20:23,826 --> 00:20:25,188
I'll let you know.

287
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:27,075
Thanks.

288
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,113
<i>Finally, peace and quiet.</i>

289
00:20:40,215 --> 00:20:41,819
<i>No crying baby.</i>

290
00:20:41,854 --> 00:20:43,021

<i>and blood.</i>

294
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:01,378
<i>And Mister Benito Gomez.</i>

295
00:21:01,382 --> 00:21:04,126
<i>Hard to find a
?lock stock? boxer like you.</i>

296
00:21:07,205 --> 00:21:10,793
<i>Trailer park.
Great, kids, neighbours.</i>

297
00:21:10,995 --> 00:21:12,368
<i>More kids.</i>

298
00:21:12,694 --> 00:21:14,563
<i>Sounds like my world.</i>

299
00:21:20,304 --> 00:21:21,823
<i>But this,...</i>

300
00:21:22,476 --> 00:21:26,388
<i>the only still open for business
establishment in a lonely strip mall.</i>

301
00:21:26,396 --> 00:21:28,119
<i>That's kinda calling to me.</i>

302
00:21:29,158 --> 00:21:30,903
<i>This feels good.</i>

303
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:36,335
Hey, you.

304
00:21:36,506 --> 00:21:38,065
Hey, Dex.
You're alone?

305
00:21:38,145 --> 00:21:39,609
Yeah, why?

306
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,634
Well, Harrison won't
go down for his nap.

307
00:21:41,728 --> 00:21:43,485
Surprise, surprise.

308
00:21:43,965 --> 00:21:45,945
You think maybe you could sing to him?

309
00:21:46,526 --> 00:21:47,723
You bet.

310
00:21:47,997 --> 00:21:50,911
Okay. I will gonna put you on speaker.

311
00:21:53,135 --> 00:21:58,463
Oh beautiful for spacious skies,...

312
00:21:58,498 --> 00:22:02,550
for amber waves of grain,...

313
00:22:03,693 --> 00:22:08,361
for purple mountain majesty,...

314
00:22:08,373 --> 00:22:12,352
above the fruited plain!

315
00:22:12,968 --> 00:22:18,342
America! America! God...

316
00:22:19,665 --> 00:22:21,334
He's finally calming.

317
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:24,394
Thank you, Dexter.
I love you.

318
00:22:24,947 --> 00:22:26,466
Me too.

319
00:22:27,438 --> 00:22:30,228
<i>First up today finish
the Lisa Bell blood work.</i>

320
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:32,460
<i>Tonight, a little Benny Gomez recon.</i>

321
00:22:32,495 --> 00:22:34,827
<i>Then go home and
sing the last 95 verses of...</i>

322
00:22:34,828 --> 00:22:37,240
<i>"America, the beautiful" to my baby son.</i>

323
00:22:37,844 --> 00:22:40,231
<i>Who knew live can get so...</i>

324
00:22:40,266 --> 00:22:41,653
<i>unsimple?</i>

325
00:22:43,314 --> 00:22:44,553
I can deal.

326
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:45,838
I can deal.

327
00:22:55,035 --> 00:22:57,241
Yo, Quinn. Boobs
plus drinks equals...

328
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:59,261
Tell you, boy, I can't.
Got a date.

329
00:23:01,638 --> 00:23:02,791
How about you, Morgan?

330
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:04,692
Stud-muffin still out of town?

331
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:07,369
It's tempting, Masuka.
Anyhow again,...

332
00:23:07,465 --> 00:23:08,641
fuck off and die,...

333
00:23:08,765 --> 00:23:11,103
- and die again.
- So that's a no?

334
00:23:11,113 --> 00:23:13,020
I'm feeling no love here, folks.

335
00:23:13,055 --> 00:23:14,162
Then it's working.

336
00:23:14,216 --> 00:23:16,488
Hey, slacker!
Half-day?

337
00:23:16,535 --> 00:23:19,033
This is me leaving, Vince.
I do it everyday.

338
00:23:19,068 --> 00:23:20,205
But everyday wasn't like today.

339
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:21,639
What you went through?
Come on!

340
00:23:21,642 --> 00:23:23,164
Drinks are all on me.
And it'll cheer you up!

341
00:23:23,191 --> 00:23:24,956
I'm not uncheered.

342
00:23:24,957 --> 00:23:26,710
Yeah?
Tell that to your face!

343
00:23:27,116 --> 00:23:28,461
I'm going home to my family.

344
00:23:28,487 --> 00:23:29,759
Vastly overrated.

345
00:23:29,796 --> 00:23:31,254
Just got a call from robbery.

346
00:23:31,255 --> 00:23:33,604
Some guy in his honeymoon
took a shot in the head.

347
00:23:33,605 --> 00:23:36,213
Grave condition,
they're pulling the plug tomorrow.

348
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,897
Nice fucking wedding gift.

349
00:23:38,065 --> 00:23:41,098
Yeah, the file is gonna land
on my desk first thing in the morning.

350
00:23:41,133 --> 00:23:42,597
And robbery has got squad.

351
00:23:42,603 --> 00:23:44,451
It's gonna be a total goat fuck.

352
00:23:44,526 --> 00:23:46,477
It sounds like you need a drink, papi.

353
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:48,874
You know what, Vince?
I can use a Cuevo...

354
00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:49,925
or ten.

355
00:24:17,787 --> 00:24:20,628
<i>My dark passenger is
like a trapped coal miner,...</i>

356
00:24:20,629 --> 00:24:23,881
<i>always tapping,
always letting me know it's still in there,...</i>

357
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:24,930
<i>still alive.</i>

358
00:24:26,857 --> 00:24:30,431
<i>Quinn's legwork may have
shown me where to find our friend,...</i>

359
00:24:30,477 --> 00:24:31,920
<i>but this, Benny...</i>

360
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:36,060
<i>My bloodwork is
the stuff that seals your fate.</i>

361
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:52,724
<i>No security cameras,
parks away from the lights,...</i>

362
00:24:53,943 --> 00:24:56,831
<i>You just come and go as you please.</i>

363
00:24:58,076 --> 00:25:02,069
<i>But as of tomorrow night,
those days are over.</i>

364
00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:13,401
I wasn't sure you actually come by.

365
00:25:16,554 --> 00:25:18,763
I did my face-time with Masuka...

366
00:25:19,315 --> 00:25:21,883
and then I came to
where I really wanted to be.

367
00:25:28,905 --> 00:25:30,701
Tell me again this isn't crazy.

368
00:25:30,736 --> 00:25:32,802
Yeah, it's crazy.

369
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,462
Crazy good.

370
00:25:55,004 --> 00:25:56,275
Keep shooting.

371
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,716
He's so sweet,
when he is sleeping.

372
00:26:04,594 --> 00:26:06,435
Pure and innocent.

373
00:26:06,896 --> 00:26:08,899
Well, then we grow up,...

374
00:26:10,005 --> 00:26:11,395
things happen.

375
00:26:13,326 --> 00:26:15,201
Nothing's gonna happen.

376
00:26:15,526 --> 00:26:18,599
Not when he has a
great dad watching over him.

377
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,144
Yeah, he's a lucky guy.

378
00:26:28,284 --> 00:26:29,500
Astor!

379
00:26:30,786 --> 00:26:32,721
- Mom!
- Turn that down!

380
00:26:32,756 --> 00:26:33,880
We wouldn't have this problem,...

381
00:26:33,881 --> 00:26:36,828
- if you would just give me an i...
- This is not how you go about getting an iPod.

382
00:26:36,915 --> 00:26:38,550
Now since you woke your brother up,

383
00:26:38,551 --> 00:26:40,967
you can walk him around
in the living room until he falls asleep.

384
00:26:40,968 --> 00:26:44,010
- But he never sleeps!
- Think about that next time.

385
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:50,495
Here you go.

386
00:26:52,187 --> 00:26:54,542
You'd like an iPod,
wouldn't you, little Harrison?

387
00:26:57,167 --> 00:26:59,649
Why not just end the terror
and give her an iPod?

388
00:27:00,658 --> 00:27:03,979
No, it's a power play.
She is trying to manipulate us...

389
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,722
to get what she wants.
That's not how it works in this family.

390
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:07,740
Oh, right.

391
00:27:07,886 --> 00:27:08,972
Of course.

392
00:27:10,603 --> 00:27:12,974
Cody?
No more Marco Polo in the mornings.

393
00:27:12,975 --> 00:27:15,864
- But it's important!
- So is being ready for school.

394
00:27:16,142 --> 00:27:18,716
When I grow up I wanna be just like you.

395
00:27:18,717 --> 00:27:20,811
Do what I want, when I want.

396
00:27:20,814 --> 00:27:22,280
<i>You and me both.</i>

397
00:27:22,363 --> 00:27:24,073
I wanna be just like you.

398
00:27:25,446 --> 00:27:27,373
- Marco?
- Polo!

399
00:27:40,803 --> 00:27:42,681
Great time last night, huh, Angel?

400
00:27:46,296 --> 00:27:47,412
What?

401
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:49,420
?Give it to? you'd fuck that stripper.

402
00:27:54,856 --> 00:27:56,382
Get to work, gentlemen.

403
00:27:58,865 --> 00:28:00,453
What's got into her?

404
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:21,266
What is this?
"Extreme Home Makeover, Forensics Edition"?

405
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:22,882
When I first passed through, I found...

406
00:28:22,937 --> 00:28:25,103
some blood that didn't belong to the victim.

407
00:28:25,138 --> 00:28:26,612
Possible DNA from the Killer?

408
00:28:26,647 --> 00:28:28,924
Don't think so,
the sample was pretty degraded.

409
00:28:29,006 --> 00:28:30,183
And what's the source?

410
00:28:30,235 --> 00:28:32,252
Not sure... yet.

411
00:28:32,324 --> 00:28:34,430
Coming from you,
why does that not surprise me?

412
00:28:34,924 --> 00:28:36,574
You know he's my brother, right?

413
00:28:36,576 --> 00:28:37,650
Found something.

414
00:28:37,756 --> 00:28:38,887
Mr. Morgan.

415
00:28:42,593 --> 00:28:43,679
It's blood.

416
00:28:46,997 --> 00:28:49,890
Whole pattern. Not an incidental
spatter from the recent murder.

417
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:51,524
This is something else entirely.

418
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:52,619
Where is it from?

419
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,150
Bathtub.

420
00:28:56,844 --> 00:29:00,354
So, you're taking an already
extremely difficult case...

421
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:02,932
?including? it with your...
what, 'theories'?

422
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:03,937
I didn't put the blood there.

423
00:29:03,972 --> 00:29:05,570
And according to you
neither did our killer.

424
00:29:05,576 --> 00:29:08,182
Joey, why don't we step outside,
that the geeks get their geek on?

425
00:29:09,923 --> 00:29:12,829
Okay, I gotta be somewhere, so see
if you can work things down around here...

426
00:29:12,864 --> 00:29:15,153
without going all asshole
on my brother, okay?

427
00:29:30,347 --> 00:29:31,620
<i>Blood tells.</i>

428
00:29:31,704 --> 00:29:33,102
<i>Blood always tells.</i>

429
00:29:41,805 --> 00:29:42,809
Dexter.

430
00:29:43,632 --> 00:29:45,999
How is my favorite
blood spatter analyst?

431
00:29:46,754 --> 00:29:47,905
Uh, great.

432
00:29:48,094 --> 00:29:50,510
How is my favorite
serial killer hunter?

433
00:29:51,304 --> 00:29:52,917
You just missed Deb.

434
00:29:53,382 --> 00:29:55,063
Actually I'm here to see you.

435
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:59,621
- Oh.
- Database has a girl killed here recently.

436
00:29:59,838 --> 00:30:01,599
Severed femoral artery?

437
00:30:02,565 --> 00:30:04,087
Pretty brutal.

438
00:30:07,031 --> 00:30:08,790
Crime scene telling you anything?

439
00:30:09,097 --> 00:30:10,339
Not much.

440
00:30:12,885 --> 00:30:14,646
Killer was careful, right?

441
00:30:15,015 --> 00:30:16,196
Immaculate.

442
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,330
Very.

443
00:30:19,445 --> 00:30:21,956
Well, you're in the middle
of something here, I...

444
00:30:21,957 --> 00:30:23,343
I don't want to interrupt.

445
00:30:24,215 --> 00:30:26,164
Mind if I drop by the station later?

446
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,906
Sure, not a problem.

447
00:30:31,588 --> 00:30:33,232
Good seeing you again, Dexter.

448
00:30:39,107 --> 00:30:40,197
<i>Shit!</i>

449
00:30:58,725 --> 00:30:59,885
Hello detective.

450
00:31:00,266 --> 00:31:01,566
Why don't you come in?

451
00:31:03,145 --> 00:31:05,074
I'm here to talk about Harry Morgan.

452
00:31:05,896 --> 00:31:09,967
I'm his daughter, Debra.
Debra Morgan.

453
00:31:13,174 --> 00:31:16,274
Handsome Harry Morgan.
How is he?

454
00:31:17,304 --> 00:31:18,880
He died a while back.

455
00:31:22,356 --> 00:31:24,193
Life does tend to suck.

456
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,476
Did you and my father have...

457
00:31:30,528 --> 00:31:32,350
a good relationship?

458
00:31:33,837 --> 00:31:34,910
No.

459
00:31:37,804 --> 00:31:39,930
Your father was a driven man.

460
00:31:40,752 --> 00:31:42,323
He saw something he wanted,...

461
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,926
nothing got in his way.

462
00:31:44,876 --> 00:31:46,683
Are you talking about women?

463
00:31:46,718 --> 00:31:48,581
Women, bad guys,...

464
00:31:48,646 --> 00:31:49,691
anything,...

465
00:31:51,191 --> 00:31:52,212
anyone.

466
00:31:53,603 --> 00:31:54,720
Harry always said,...

467
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:57,794
the only word, that wasn't
in his vocabulary, was 'No'.

468
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,220
Did you say no to him?

469
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,608
Dear.
I said yes.

470
00:32:06,296 --> 00:32:07,779
All the time.

471
00:32:08,814 --> 00:32:10,010
Shit.

472
00:32:10,418 --> 00:32:12,013
Hundreds of times.

473
00:32:14,554 --> 00:32:16,326
Only problem was...

474
00:32:20,155 --> 00:32:21,651
Only problem was what?

475
00:32:25,178 --> 00:32:28,277
I was saying yes to
a question he never asked.

476
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:32,337
So you didn't have
an affair with my father?

477
00:32:33,574 --> 00:32:37,306
I don't know who you're looking
for, honey, but it ain't me.

478
00:32:47,996 --> 00:32:50,520
<i>Shut down for decades,
way out of town.</i>

479
00:32:50,565 --> 00:32:52,439
I'm liking this.

480
00:32:53,256 --> 00:32:55,868
<i>Broken down box room,
broken down arena.</i>

481
00:32:56,645 --> 00:33:00,660
<i>A fitting place for a punk like
Benny Gomez to go down for the con.</i>

482
00:33:08,395 --> 00:33:09,412
Where've you been?

483
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:13,979
- Looking for misery.
- No upside to that.

484
00:33:14,014 --> 00:33:15,481
So I'm fucking learning.

485
00:33:16,466 --> 00:33:18,020
That's all we got on the groom.

486
00:33:18,055 --> 00:33:20,017
Plug was pulled 4:45 this morning.

487
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:21,430
It's all your's.

488
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:25,401
A man's life and death
reduced to a few...

489
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:27,565
- What do you call them?
- Bytes.

490
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,175
A few bytes. Just like that.

491
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:32,478
With this economy, last thing
our city needs is dead tourists.

492
00:33:32,515 --> 00:33:35,191
Hey,
"Welcome to Miami. Have a nice day."

493
00:33:35,706 --> 00:33:38,230
- Is that our tourist, sergeant?
- It is, lieutenant.

494
00:33:38,231 --> 00:33:40,841
Okay, the mayor has already given
me an aneurism over this one, so...

495
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,150
- make it a quick solve.
- Okay.

496
00:33:45,866 --> 00:33:49,973
So, whatever happened between you
and that Barbara Gianni from vice?

497
00:33:50,016 --> 00:33:51,360
We broke up.

498
00:33:51,495 --> 00:33:53,146
Wanted different things.

499
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:56,164
Office romances doom
before they fucking start.

500
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:57,593
Do you mind if I ask her out?

501
00:33:57,645 --> 00:33:58,922
Knock yourself out.

502
00:34:21,906 --> 00:34:25,066
The perfect husband would have
gotten rid of his old appartment,...

503
00:34:25,101 --> 00:34:26,412
but I kill people.

504
00:34:26,783 --> 00:34:28,883
Not exactly the perfect husband.

505
00:34:35,585 --> 00:34:37,390
Someone new is moving in.

506
00:34:38,984 --> 00:34:40,432
Be nice.

507
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:35,034
The land, the time
and "Florida Electric" forgot.

508
00:35:49,596 --> 00:35:51,063
Look at this place!

509
00:35:51,122 --> 00:35:55,237
All the cheering,
all the triumph, all the blood,...

510
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:57,683
all for sport,...

511
00:35:58,945 --> 00:36:00,959
until tonight.

512
00:36:38,306 --> 00:36:41,588
Keep at it, Benny,
and you'll be feeling no pain.

513
00:36:43,195 --> 00:36:44,809
Better that way.

514
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:12,021
Tell me you got a reason
for sleeping alone in your car...

515
00:37:12,035 --> 00:37:14,677
outside a bar other than you're drunk.

516
00:37:15,323 --> 00:37:16,727
I'm tired.

517
00:37:17,186 --> 00:37:19,605
License and registration please?

518
00:37:27,035 --> 00:37:29,676
Sorry about this, officer,
it's not what it looks like.

519
00:37:32,194 --> 00:37:33,655
You're with homicide?

520
00:37:33,662 --> 00:37:34,740
Yes, sir.

521
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:36,338
Then you ought to know better.

522
00:37:36,407 --> 00:37:37,972
Get out of the car, please.

523
00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:47,338
- You know your ABC?
- Of course I do.

524
00:37:47,373 --> 00:37:48,763
Give me 'em backwards.

525
00:37:50,823 --> 00:37:55,612
Z, Y, X, W...

526
00:37:56,215 --> 00:38:00,194
V, U, T, S, R, Q...

527
00:38:01,184 --> 00:38:05,315
P, O, N, M, L, K...
- Shut up already. You're not drunk...

528
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,479
...yet.

529
00:38:10,233 --> 00:38:14,599
Damn it, Benny! I can't go chasing
after you with a cop up my ass.

530
00:38:15,515 --> 00:38:18,605
You got more important
places to be, Mr. Morgan.

531
00:38:20,963 --> 00:38:22,714
Tell me about it.

532
00:38:31,152 --> 00:38:32,291
Hey.

533
00:38:33,283 --> 00:38:35,206
Thought you were working late.

534
00:38:35,803 --> 00:38:37,273
So did I.

535
00:38:38,745 --> 00:38:40,216
Baby is down.

536
00:38:40,425 --> 00:38:41,982
You know what that means?

537
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,953
Sleep.

538
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,858
- Sex!
- Oh.

539
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:50,929
And I'm not talking the ?diminished?,
frantic, the kids are asleep sex.

540
00:38:50,964 --> 00:38:54,840
but slow, hot, steamy, naughty sex.

541
00:38:54,841 --> 00:38:56,533
No, look, I'm feeling too tired.

542
00:39:01,015 --> 00:39:05,223
Dexter, ever since
the move and the baby...

543
00:39:05,227 --> 00:39:08,000
- we have slept zero time together.
- Yeah.

544
00:39:08,035 --> 00:39:10,281
Well, aren't you as horny as I am?

545
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:13,329
Of course I am.

546
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:19,142
Very well, just... close your eyes.

547
00:39:22,363 --> 00:39:24,893
Maybe I can squeeze in a power nap.

548
00:39:25,216 --> 00:39:26,559
Okay, open.

549
00:39:30,405 --> 00:39:31,532
Or not.

550
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:34,917
I was saving this for when we
finally got some real time alone,...

551
00:39:36,294 --> 00:39:37,651
and,...

552
00:39:40,896 --> 00:39:44,303
and, tonight is the night.

553
00:40:00,126 --> 00:40:02,282
It's alright, I'll go.

554
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:06,315
You've already done so much.

555
00:40:09,936 --> 00:40:11,012
Look at that.

556
00:40:16,093 --> 00:40:19,178
Yeah, who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

557
00:40:20,191 --> 00:40:21,238
Yeah.

558
00:40:29,756 --> 00:40:31,718
Wanna know a secret?

559
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,099
Daddy kills people.

560
00:40:40,283 --> 00:40:42,188
Well, bad people.

561
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:47,869
Not really anybody else
I can tell about that, you know?

562
00:40:56,104 --> 00:40:58,451
Daddy's not going anywhere, buddy.

563
00:41:02,564 --> 00:41:06,328
I already lost my innocence,
I'm not gonna sacrifice yours, too.

564
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:21,301
"Triple Red Eye", please.

565
00:41:21,573 --> 00:41:24,152
It's your third one today, bro,
I feel if you're not backing,...

566
00:41:24,184 --> 00:41:25,890
You're tempting the heart gods.

567
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:28,134
Least of my worries,

568
00:41:28,662 --> 00:41:29,839
...bro.

569
00:41:30,582 --> 00:41:32,267
Brought you a copy of my article.

570
00:41:32,372 --> 00:41:34,336
Think you'd do a dumb cop
not knowing the paper.

571
00:41:34,382 --> 00:41:36,949
Thank you, some I've read.
I never miss the obituaries.

572
00:41:36,956 --> 00:41:39,121
Front page.
Nice.

573
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:41,884
Yeah, I do what I can.
My editor okayed to follow up,...

574
00:41:41,885 --> 00:41:43,081
you got anything for me?

575
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:44,854
Would, if I could, but I got nothing.

576
00:41:45,174 --> 00:41:48,558
Besides, off the record,
we got bigger fish to fry.

577
00:41:49,294 --> 00:41:50,669
What kind of fish?

578
00:41:51,953 --> 00:41:53,299
Off the record.

579
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:56,550
You know those pricks who've
been shaken down tourists?

580
00:41:56,585 --> 00:41:57,902
The vacation robbers?

581
00:41:57,934 --> 00:41:59,556
No, the vacation murderers.

582
00:41:59,591 --> 00:42:02,262
They shot some poor newly wed.
Didn't make it, so...

583
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,445
we're more than a little distracted.

584
00:42:06,334 --> 00:42:09,845
You want another distraction?
I'd love to take you out for a drink.

585
00:42:10,056 --> 00:42:14,981
You know, to thank you
for your help with the bathtub story...

586
00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:20,246
- I'm so not hitting on you.
- Yeah, me neither.

587
00:42:20,281 --> 00:42:21,375
Let's make it dinner.

588
00:42:27,013 --> 00:42:29,644
I've got the bloodwork back
from the bathroom do-over.

589
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:30,958
Did you run it through the database?

590
00:42:30,959 --> 00:42:33,988
No point. The bloody swab
shows shit all on the DNA front.

591
00:42:33,994 --> 00:42:36,187
Our chances of finding out
who it belongs to are about...

592
00:42:36,215 --> 00:42:38,311
uh... one in six fucking billion?

593
00:42:40,234 --> 00:42:42,849
What was Lisa Bell's adress?

594
00:42:43,323 --> 00:42:45,342
1578 Glencoe, why?

595
00:42:45,868 --> 00:42:48,883
Well, the DNA won't
tell us who it belonged to,...

596
00:42:48,884 --> 00:42:50,188
maybe the adress.

597
00:42:51,095 --> 00:42:55,688
1578 Glencoe,
11. April 1979, homicide.

598
00:42:55,689 --> 00:42:57,155
1979?

599
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:06,496
Vicky Noonan, 22,
found in the bath tub, bled out.

600
00:43:06,497 --> 00:43:08,081
An incision to her thigh.

601
00:43:08,771 --> 00:43:10,463
What are the chances of that?

602
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:12,365
What are the chances of what?

603
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:15,355
Special agent Lundy.

604
00:43:15,356 --> 00:43:17,780
Vincent Masuka, if memory serves.

605
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:19,975
That's right.

606
00:43:20,757 --> 00:43:22,273
LFI on the PHB.

607
00:43:23,821 --> 00:43:25,321
You're working a case, right?

608
00:43:25,322 --> 00:43:27,935
- Feds need us to...
- Mind if I speak with Dexter?

609
00:43:29,431 --> 00:43:34,346
Uh, well, I go to records
and get the write-up on Noonan.

610
00:43:35,664 --> 00:43:37,153
Just doing my job.

611
00:43:42,932 --> 00:43:44,192
He's right.

612
00:43:44,942 --> 00:43:45,866
About?

613
00:43:45,867 --> 00:43:47,108
Why I'm in Miami.

614
00:43:47,733 --> 00:43:49,028
It is a case.

615
00:43:49,554 --> 00:43:50,963
Yeah, i figured.

616
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:55,037
So why do you need me of
the full resources of the FBI?

617
00:43:55,573 --> 00:43:57,152
Not anymore.

618
00:43:57,153 --> 00:43:58,437
I'm retired.

619
00:44:00,605 --> 00:44:02,229
Their loss.

620
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:06,680
Yeah, well. I fish, travel and...

621
00:44:06,715 --> 00:44:11,655
now I have the time to track down
the one twisted son of a bitch who got away.

622
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,657
So, who is the twisted son of a bitch?

623
00:44:16,407 --> 00:44:18,377
I call him the trinity killer.

624
00:44:19,164 --> 00:44:23,070
Kills in threes. Been doing it
all over the country for years.

625
00:44:23,071 --> 00:44:25,449
Problem is, I can't prove he exists.

626
00:44:25,902 --> 00:44:28,015
Law enforcement
doesn't talk to each other.

627
00:44:28,868 --> 00:44:31,297
So no one at the FBI is even on board.

628
00:44:32,777 --> 00:44:35,937
Just me, and I'm looking for a break.

629
00:44:35,938 --> 00:44:38,012
- Then this happens.
- Lisa Bell.

630
00:44:38,396 --> 00:44:41,358
Her murder profile
fits the previous victims.

631
00:44:42,983 --> 00:44:45,158
Trinity is in Miami, Dexter,...

632
00:44:45,792 --> 00:44:47,855
starting his cycle all over again.

633
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:55,314
No! No! No!

634
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,979
How far back do your cases go?

635
00:44:58,312 --> 00:44:59,907
About fifteen years.

636
00:45:00,321 --> 00:45:04,259
The house and room,
where Lisa Bell was murdered,...

637
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:08,259
was the site of a very similar
homicide thirty years ago.

638
00:45:09,005 --> 00:45:10,696
Take a look.

639
00:45:13,938 --> 00:45:17,526
No! No!

640
00:45:18,404 --> 00:45:21,847
Always come full-circled.
He's back where his ?coming? began.

641
00:45:22,857 --> 00:45:25,884
Thirty years.
You know, what this means?

642
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:32,265
Trinity is the most successful serial killer,
who would ever get away with it.

643
00:45:56,157 --> 00:45:57,579
What? I'm fine.

644
00:45:57,956 --> 00:45:59,282
Can't wait to see you.

645
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:06,255
Anton, I have to go,
I have a meeting.

646
00:46:10,654 --> 00:46:11,840
Hello, Debra.

647
00:46:14,294 --> 00:46:16,158
Motherfucking fuck.

648
00:46:18,177 --> 00:46:19,863
Nice to see you too.

649
00:46:20,425 --> 00:46:24,876
Fuck. What are you doing here?

650
00:46:25,387 --> 00:46:27,213
Are you here on a case?

651
00:46:28,466 --> 00:46:30,501
Actually I'm retired now.

652
00:46:31,494 --> 00:46:33,024
Yet you're here.

653
00:46:33,794 --> 00:46:36,338
Life has a natural forward momentum.

654
00:46:36,363 --> 00:46:38,760
Certain things are inevitable.

655
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,883
Like you,...

656
00:46:43,796 --> 00:46:45,308
making detective.

657
00:46:45,655 --> 00:46:47,731
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

658
00:46:47,766 --> 00:46:49,324
I never had any doubt.

659
00:46:52,445 --> 00:46:56,875
So, how long will your foward
momentum keep you in Miami?

660
00:46:57,593 --> 00:46:59,977
Not sure exactly.

661
00:47:04,133 --> 00:47:05,551
Be seeing you.

662
00:47:05,734 --> 00:47:06,874
Yeah.

663
00:47:08,405 --> 00:47:11,200
I guess, I maybe...
I mean, I don't know.

664
00:47:29,113 --> 00:47:31,277
Big plans this evening, sergeant?

665
00:47:31,902 --> 00:47:33,871
The usual, lieutenant.

666
00:47:47,245 --> 00:47:48,523
Hey, guys.

667
00:47:50,314 --> 00:47:51,554
Drinks?

668
00:47:54,756 --> 00:47:57,843
<i>I had Benny Gomez
on the ropes and let him slip away.</i>

669
00:47:58,152 --> 00:48:00,145
<i>No way I can go to that bar again.</i>

670
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,696
<i>Officer Alphabet made sure of that.</i>

671
00:48:02,731 --> 00:48:04,881
<i>Which means I grab
Benny, where he lives.</i>

672
00:48:05,343 --> 00:48:08,479
<i>A higher degree of difficulty,
but I don't have a choice.</i>

673
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:11,870
<i>If I wanna be around for my son,
I have to do this right.</i>

674
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:14,631
<i>I'm killing for two now.</i>

675
00:48:39,332 --> 00:48:40,715
What do you want?

676
00:48:41,756 --> 00:48:43,064
You.

677
00:48:55,995 --> 00:48:57,354
<i>Look at him.</i>

678
00:48:57,389 --> 00:48:58,937
<i>Fast asleep.</i>

679
00:48:59,657 --> 00:49:01,058
<i>Lucky guy.</i>

680
00:49:25,434 --> 00:49:26,788
I know you.

681
00:49:30,796 --> 00:49:32,224
I'm the blood guy.

682
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:55,980
You've made a lot of
people very miserable.

683
00:49:56,704 --> 00:49:58,036
Me included.

684
00:50:02,392 --> 00:50:03,858
So now...

685
00:50:09,383 --> 00:50:12,559
<i>Because now I get to
answer live's big question.</i>

686
00:50:12,727 --> 00:50:14,468
<i>My live anyway.</i>

687
00:50:19,896 --> 00:50:22,576
Can I do it?
Can I have it all?

688
00:50:25,724 --> 00:50:27,225
Ah, shit!

689
00:50:32,546 --> 00:50:33,397
Hello?

690
00:50:33,691 --> 00:50:36,242
Dexter, I need you to go to an
all night pharmacy right away.

691
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,135
I'm kinda in the middle of something.

692
00:50:38,234 --> 00:50:41,646
Harrison has an ear infection.
He's in a lot of pain, Dexter.

693
00:50:41,681 --> 00:50:43,561
Whatever you're doing can wait.

694
00:50:44,633 --> 00:50:47,950
Oh, right, my mistake.
I wasn't thinking. I'm on my way.

695
00:50:50,446 --> 00:50:51,825
Kids...

696
00:50:59,407 --> 00:51:02,518
Got to go.
No time to savor this.

697
00:51:03,314 --> 00:51:04,604
The clock's ticking.

698
00:51:05,263 --> 00:51:07,450
Well, this is all about sacrifice,...

699
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:09,241
the good of the family.

700
00:51:57,872 --> 00:51:59,658
<i>Maybe the night wasn't perfect.</i>

701
00:51:59,684 --> 00:52:02,474
<i>Maybe I need to reboot
the way I do things.</i>

702
00:52:05,744 --> 00:52:08,037
<i>But at least I'm on the right road.</i>

703
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:13,188
<i>I'm on my way to taking care
of my family, raising my son,...</i>

704
00:52:13,223 --> 00:52:18,140
<i>and all the while doing what I have to do
to satisfy a calling that I can't ignore...</i>

705
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,636
<i>or deny.</i>

706
00:52:23,556 --> 00:52:25,007
<i>I can do this.</i>

707
00:52:30,466 --> 00:52:31,834
Dexter!

708
00:52:34,006 --> 00:52:36,219
You don't need to sleep!

709
00:52:39,006 --> 00:52:40,802
You need to wake up!
