2
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,555
Previously on Dexter.

3
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,766
It's for sure. I'm pregnant.

4
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,644
What kind of father would l be?

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,729
After all, l kill people.

6
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,023
Aah!

7
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,901
Me? Demented daddy Dexter.

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:27,985
(Moaning)

9
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:32,907
This child is happening.
But your role in its life is entirely up to you.

10
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,035
(Debra) Yesterday morning you said
when the case ends, we end.

11
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,079
(Lundy) I thought you understood
when we got involved.

12
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,956
I track killers. That's what I do.

13
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,958
A pattern of bodies
was identified in Oregon.

14
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:43,251
My flight leaves tonight.

15
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,712
If you're leaving,
we gotta work out logistics.

16
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:48,214
Do you honestly want
to go down this path?

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,591
(Dexter) I don't know if I'm
going to be a father to the kid.

18
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,927
(Debra) How could even say you're not
gonna be a father to that kid?

19
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,430
I mean, where would you be
without Harry?

20
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,933
(Dexter) Harry knew my mother.
Laura Moser was his informant.

21
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,518
Was he just using her?

22
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,520
Was he using me?

23
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,272
Dad wasn't perfect, Deb.

24
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,232
What did he do? Cheat on Mom?

25
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:09,318
- Bullshit. Who?
- I need all the records you have

26
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:11,279
on my dad's confidential informants.

27
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,782
- Attractive female CI's?
- Why, you know something?

28
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,368
There's a good reason
why Quinn's of interest to IA.

29
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,496
Internal Affairs is investigating you.
Is there something you're not telling us?

30
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,165
Anton is not officially a CI.

31
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,001
- What do you mean?
- I never filed an arrest report on him.

32
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,336
You are the best thing
that has happened to me.

33
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,591
Just sending out my positive
intentions to our baby.

34
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:34,552
You know, we're connected.
You're what makes me real.

35
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,804
Please say yes.

36
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,182
Yes, we will marry you.

37
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:43,478
Syl has offered to list my house
so we can buy something bigger.

38
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:47,398
Better hope she doesn't insist
on a place with central air.

39
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,442
(Dexter) I was actually thinking
I might keep my place.

40
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,778
"No" doesn't really work
in a relationship, Dexter.

41
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:54,614
Every man needs his privacy.
Some more than others.

42
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,617
ls it possible
l've actually made a friend?

43
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,952
Someone I can trust
with my dark secrets?

44
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,914
I didn't teach you the code
to share with your buddies.

45
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,334
Miguel really did it.
And l taught him how.

46
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,961
Harry was right. He used me.

47
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,507
You're all just unchecked
versions of myself,

48
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,842
what I would've become
without my father's code.

49
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,093
(Strangled scream)

50
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,430
I could kill you now.

51
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,850
- I've never felt this.
- You've never had a son before.

52
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,352
You want to see him
come into the world.

53
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,647
Yes. I've never wanted anything
so much in my life.

54
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,526
(Sirens)

55
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,653
l have moved on from my father,

56
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,780
but l still need his code.

57
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:39,200
But right now, life is good.

58
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,285
Dexter Morgan, family man.

59
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,584
Tonight's the night.

60
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,925
The night when a primal,
sacred need caIIs to me.

61
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:04,345
l've waited and waited.

62
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,223
But tonight, this night...

63
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,144
..it's time.

64
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,841
Tonight's the night l finally...

65
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,302
..sleep.

66
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,076
(Water running)

67
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,550
(Creak)

68
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,015
(Creaking)

69
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,483
(Gasps, screams)

70
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,735
No...

71
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,445
(Screaming)

72
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,906
(Baby cries)

73
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,115
(Sighs)

74
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,950
(Crying)

75
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:53,120
OK, Harrison.
The driving thing didn't work.

76
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,789
The singing thing didn't work.

77
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,292
You planning on both of us not sleeping
for another three months?

78
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,461
(Crying)

79
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,588
Apparently so.

80
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:07,802
OK, I want to take you inside,
but I don't want you waking Mommy.

81
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:11,138
- (Jangling)
- Hey.

82
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,475
If you could talk, you'd tell me
not to worry about you, right?

83
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,272
(Woman) No...

84
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,776
(Sobbing, choking) Oh, please.

85
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,195
No, don't...

86
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,489
No.

87
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,449
Please.

88
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,285
Please. Please.

89
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,080
Shh.

90
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,167
It's already over.

91
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,475
(Gasps)

92
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,478
(Groaning and whimpering)

93
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,078
(Yawns)

94
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,126
(Child 1 ) Marco!
(Child 2) Polo.

95
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,294
(Child 1 ) Marco.

96
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,880
(Child 2) Polo.

97
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,465
(Child 1 ) Marco...

98
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,592
There's this cliché
where serial killers

99
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,262
are always described as,
"Quiet, kept to himself. Kind of a loner."

100
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,264
(Toy quacks)

101
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,725
lt's a cliché for a reason.

102
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,102
(♪ Pop music playing)

103
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,271
Has anybody seen my keys?

104
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,523
(Rita) Astor, I asked you
to keep it down.

105
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,108
(Sighs)

106
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,028
Why do you hate my music
so much?

107
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,488
I don't hate your music.

108
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,156
You don't?

109
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,368
Cody, get out of the Larsons' pool.
It's time for school.

110
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,954
If I had an iPod, you wouldn't
have to listen to my stuff.

111
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,499
You want an iPod, earn one.
Do your chores. Unpack your room.

112
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,042
God, you are so unfair!

113
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,882
Did you get any sleep?

114
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,634
Uh, an hour and a half, maybe.

115
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,302
Oh, and you have court.

116
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,304
Look, I appreciate you
taking the night shift,

117
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,140
but when you have a big day like today,
it's OK to wake me up.

118
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,310
Well, it's kind of on-the-job training,
you know?

119
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,397
All that matters
is his father's there for him.

120
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,358
- I cannot find keys...
- Cody!

121
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,026
Astor, the music.

122
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,070
You usually leave them
right here by the phone.

123
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,863
I know.

124
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,783
- School. Clothes. Now.
- Sorry.

125
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:25,207
You don't get some sleep, it won't be
your keys that get lost, it'll be your mind.

126
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,793
I lost that years ago.

127
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,601
Dexter Morgan,
good suburban husband.

128
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:47,396
Happy father of three.

129
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,023
On paper, anyway.

130
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,066
(Children laughing)

131
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,068
Hey, Dex, what's the news?

132
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,653
Uh, too soon to tell.

133
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,906
Dexter? Dexter, you forgot
your cell phone.

134
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,869
Oh, good morning, Elliot.

135
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,747
Another beautiful day.
More pool time for the kids.

136
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,958
Well, you already took the morning shift,
so I'll watch them this afternoon.

137
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,752
Takes a village.

138
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,547
(Chuckles)

139
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,507
- (Cody roars)
- (Shrieks)

140
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:20,220
- Ah. Mm.
- (Cody) Take that!

141
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,556
Car pools and swimming pools.

142
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,850
How much are we living the dream?

143
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,354
- So much.
- (Laughs)

144
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,399
Living the dream.

145
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,569
(Moaning)

146
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,406
(Man) Mm.

147
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:44,078
Hey, um, do you think you can
TiVo Jon Stewart for me?

148
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,246
(Anton) Mm.

149
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,916
Thinking about Jon Stewart, huh?

150
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,376
(Chuckles)

151
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,920
Well, he is handsome.

152
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,505
(Giggles)

153
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,256
And funny.

154
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,175
I love you.

155
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,349
(Debra) Oh, fuck me.

156
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,726
That's kind of where this is heading.

157
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,436
No. I'm late for work.

158
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,564
(He sighs)

159
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,738
It's a good thing you moved in,
or I'd never see you.

160
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,116
Well, one of us has to live here.

161
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,869
At least with the cruise ship,
I get to see you every few days.

162
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,913
- I went on tour...
- I know.

163
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,748
It's OK, I kind of like it.

164
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,750
Keeps you from getting sick of me.

165
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,670
- That's never going to happen.
- Yeah, because you're never here.

166
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:38,090
No, because you make me happy.

167
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,473
And what conclusions did you draw
from the blood evidence, Mr. Morgan?

168
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:50,227
I was able to determine
the victim's movement and direction

169
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:53,063
after the initial
blunt-force trauma to the head

170
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,898
caused by the defendant's fist.

171
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,567
How so?

172
00:12:56,693 --> 00:13:01,613
I...reconstructed a...

173
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,490
timeline and sequence of events

174
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,077
by examining...
It's here somewhere.

175
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,123
I noticed a passive
flow pattern bloodstain

176
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,542
approximately two meters in length

177
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,335
emanating from the head wound,

178
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:19,339
and the sample was consistent
with the sample from the defendant's shirt.

179
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,427
You did say "passive
flow pattern bloodstain"?

180
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,512
Quote, unquote.

181
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,181
What exactly do your notes say?

182
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,100
Um...

183
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,353
"The bloodstain described
a passive pooling

184
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,523
"and flow configuration,
type O negative,

185
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,860
"matching the sample taken from," um...

186
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:45,824
uh, "Leonetti's shirt."

187
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,703
But this is the Gomez hearing.

188
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,290
Yes, Mr. Morgan.
The defendant's name is Benito Gomez.

189
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,210
(Sighs) I must've brought
the wrong notes.

190
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,378
Do you frequently become
confused and disoriented

191
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,714
while conducting your spatter
analysis, Mr. Morgan?

192
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,676
No, I do not.
We...just had a new baby.

193
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,094
Things were a little hectic this morning.

194
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,847
So you're saying that you're sleep-deprived
and it's affecting yourjudgment?

195
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,891
No, it's just a momentary mix-up.

196
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,060
Wrong notes, wrong blood type.

197
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,103
Wrong defendant. Wrong case.

198
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,898
That's what you call
a momentary mix-up in a murder trial?

199
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,692
I misspoke.

200
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,653
- Oh, fuck.
- Your honor, the witness

201
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,072
has just demonstrated
how unreliable he is in a courtroom.

202
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,075
I would have to ask
how reliable his work is in the lab.

203
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,326
Or on a crime scene.

204
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,120
Moreover, how reliable
is a police department

205
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:35,123
that would place so much trust
in his expert opinion?

206
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,093
I'm halfway through
the CI files you gave me.

207
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:50,055
I were you, I'd spend more time
with that man of yours

208
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,683
and less time looking for some
old confidential informant

209
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,893
your daddy might've diddled
back in the day.

210
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,271
I meet another one tomorrow.

211
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,023
Maybe then I'll finally get
some answers.

212
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,567
Say you do.

213
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:02,776
Then what?

214
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:07,155
Then...I'll know.

215
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:11,285
That my perfect fucking father
wasn't so fucking perfect.

216
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,537
So that's what, the meaning of life?

217
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,582
The meaning of my life.

218
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,963
Hey, buddy.

219
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,798
Guess where I was yesterday.

220
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,468
- Well, I'm not sure, I...
- I was at a store.

221
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,679
Want to take a guess
what kind of store?

222
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,639
- I don't know. Grocery?
- Clothing.

223
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,391
You know me,
I'm pretty into that shit.

224
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,393
Gotta come correct and all.
But not yesterday.

225
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,770
- Look, if this is about...
- Come on, buddy. Let me finish.

226
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,315
I was at a store helping a lady
pick out a suit for her son.

227
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,400
Know why?
Because he had to be in court

228
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,110
to see the guy who killed his old man.

229
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:48,614
Kid's first fucking suit.
Something a father should be doing.

230
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,282
- I'm sorry.
- Little late for "sorry".

231
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,117
That asshole you let walk?

232
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,662
- Benito Gomez.
- Ah, now you get it right.

233
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,789
You actually see
what that fuckhead did?

234
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,751
Gomez hit the kid's old man so hard,

235
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,962
his cheekbone broke,
pushing his eyeball up and out of his face.

236
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,007
Then Gomez, sweetheart that he is,
kills the guy in front of his own son.

237
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,508
- I know.
- How about this beauty?

238
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,344
Gomez did five years
for beating his girlfriend

239
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,346
so bad even her dentist
had a hard time with the ID.

240
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,306
So is your "sorry"
gonna keep Gomez

241
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,099
from pounding somebody else
into the next world?

242
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,392
Jesus, chill out, Quinn.

243
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,562
No, Deb, he's right.
I screwed up in court today.

244
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,357
- Gomez walked. This one's on me.
- Thanks. That means so much to me.

245
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,359
Why don't you hold on to those
for me, OK, buddy?

246
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,402
I'm sick of looking at 'em.

247
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,614
- You screwed up?
- Big time.

248
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,408
Should I be worried?

249
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,328
(Sighs) No, I'll be OK.

250
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,957
Maybe it's Benny Gomez
who should be worried.

251
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,795
And good solve
on the Reynolds case, guys.

252
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,881
Next up, chief's office wants...

253
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,134
Anything I can do to keep that
angry Irish off your ass, let me know.

254
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,762
You're a real friend, Vince.

255
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,767
Quinn's a good cop.
l need a good kill.

256
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:02,145
And sometimes one just falls
into your lap.

257
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,151
We've got a body in Kendall.

258
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,861
Morgan, Quinn, you're up.

259
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,406
And, Dexter, there's blood.
Lots of blood.

260
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,417
Talk about your bloodbath.

261
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,961
(Giggles)

262
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:27,838
Tough room.

263
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:31,049
OK, femoral artery severed.
She bled out in minutes.

264
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,301
- Suicide?
- No weapon on the premises.

265
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,595
Exactly. The coroner can suck
my uncircumcised dick

266
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:36,888
if he doesn't rule this a homicide.

267
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,890
That's way TMI, Masuka.

268
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,102
Employment records show
she just got promoted to sous-chef.

269
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,271
(Masuka) A total babe.
And she could cook.

270
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,772
Had it all going on.

271
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,774
Then this.

272
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,111
It's a very well-organized crime scene.
The assailant took his time.

273
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,532
Cleaned up after himself.

274
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,409
Obviously doesn't have kids.

275
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,327
Keep an eye on our expert witness.

276
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,413
In case our girl's parents
actually want to see

277
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,749
someone go to jail for doing this
to their daughter.

278
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,628
Harsh.

279
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,757
(Chatter over police radio)

280
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,262
Christine Hill, Broward Journal dispatch.

281
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,388
And?

282
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,224
And was Ms. Bell the only victim?

283
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,895
- Who gave you her name?
- I searched the address

284
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,605
on this thing called the internet.

285
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,982
Now, what can you tell me
about the murder?

286
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,233
Suspects?

287
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,152
Murder? Suspects?

288
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,279
We still haven't officially
ruled out suicide.

289
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,449
- So it was pills?
- No.

290
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,245
Then she bled out. Women pretty much
only do one or the other.

291
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,040
Do me a favor. You break this case
before we do, give me a call.

292
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,044
It's Detective Joseph Quinn.

293
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,130
Miami Metro, extension 3734.

294
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,093
- Cell number?
- Mm.

295
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,513
Nice touch, Joseph.

296
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:15,529
Damn it.

297
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,864
Can't anyone fill up the...

298
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,200
fucking...water thing?

299
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,244
(Chuckles)

300
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,496
- Tough crime scene?
- No.

301
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,166
Mm...kind of.

302
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,336
Yes.

303
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,714
You know, when things are going good,

304
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,092
I think that's God's way
of saying to cover your ass,

305
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,678
because something's gonna
jump up and bite it, hard.

306
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,180
Well put.

307
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,224
You and Anton doing OK?

308
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,561
- Knock on wood.
- Any sign your ass is gonna get bit?

309
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,770
None.

310
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,856
So this is you just making yourself crazy?

311
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,983
That's kind of what I do.

312
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:55,735
What?

313
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,196
It's just I've taken that trip
a thousand times before.

314
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,657
- And?
- And knock it off.

315
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:03,577
Is that an order, boss?

316
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:07,289
Just some free advice from someone
who's been there before.

317
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,919
Hey, did you ever go out with that guy
that Anton wanted you to meet?

318
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,255
Musicians aren't really my thing.

319
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,049
He owns a restaurant.
Three of 'em.

320
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,218
Cuban restaurants.

321
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,429
What the fuck is wrong
with musicians?

322
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,055
That came out wrong.

323
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,975
What makes you think
a Cuban restaurant matters?

324
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,603
That came out wrong too.

325
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,814
I'm not looking
for anyone new anyway.

326
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,443
But when and if, I'll let you know.

327
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,571
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

328
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,412
(Yawns)

329
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,499
Finally. Peace and quiet.

330
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,209
No crying baby.

331
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,587
No Marco, no Polo.

332
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:59,591
Just me...and blood.

333
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,437
And Mr. Benito Gomez.

334
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:15,899
Where to find a washed-up boxer
like you?

335
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,487
Trailer park. Great.

336
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,197
Kids, neighbors.

337
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:23,990
More kids.

338
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,450
Sounds like my world.

339
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,833
But this...

340
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,671
the only still open-for-business
establishment in a lonely strip mall?

341
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,798
That's kind of calling to me.

342
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,885
- This feels good.
- (Phone rings)

343
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:47,681
Hey, you.

344
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,599
Hey, Dex. You alone?

345
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,934
Uh, yeah. Why?

346
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,852
Well, Harrison won't go down
for his nap.

347
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,688
Surprise, surprise.

348
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,273
You think maybe
you could sing to him?

349
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,401
You bet.

350
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:02,112
OK. All right, we're gonna
put you on speaker.

351
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,863
(Crying)

352
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:09,786
♪ Oh, beautiful for spacious skies

353
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:14,082
♪ For amber waves of grain
- Shh.

354
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:19,838

357
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,976
He's finally calming.

358
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:35,687
Thank you, Dexter. We love you.

359
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,814
Me too.

360
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,443
First up today,
finish the Lisa Bell blood work.

361
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,737
Tonight, a little Benny Gomez recon.

362
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,989
Then go home and sing
the last 95 verses

363
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:49,284
of America the Beautiful to my baby son.

364
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,996
Who knew life could get so...
unsimpIe?

365
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,459
I can deal. I can deal.

366
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,553
Yo, Quinn. Boobs plus drinks equals...

367
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,638
Titty bar. Can't. Got a date.

368
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:12,307
(Sighs)

369
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,225
Ah. How about you, Morgan?

370
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,102
Stud muffin still out of town?

371
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,938
It's tempting, Masuka. And elegant.

372
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:21,066
Fuck off and die.
Then die again.

373
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:22,901
So that's a no.

374
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:25,528
- I am feeling no love here, folks.
- Then it's working.

375
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,781
Hey, slacker. Half-day?

376
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,200
This is me leaving, Vince.
I do it every day.

377
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,869
But every day wasn't like today.
What you went through? Come on.

378
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,287
Drinks are on me. It'll cheer you up!

379
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,664
- I'm not uncheered.
- Yeah?

380
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:37,999
Tell that to your face.

381
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,127
- I'm going home to my family.
- Vastly overrated.

382
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,670
Just got a call from Robbery.

383
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:44,923
Some guy on his honeymoon
took a shot in the head.

384
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,467
Grave condition.
They're pulling the plug tomorrow.

385
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,010
Nice fucking wedding gift.

386
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,305
(Sighs) Yeah. The file is gonna land
on my desk first thing in the morning.

387
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,973
And Robbery's got squat.

388
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,767
It's gonna be a total goat fuck.

389
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,769
It sounds like you need a drink, papi.

390
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:58,978
You know what, Vince?

391
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:01,314
I can use a Cuervo. Or ten.

392
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,234
(Giggling)

393
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,845
My dark passenger
is like a trapped coal miner,

394
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,013
always tapping,
always letting me know

395
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,516
it's still in there, still alive.

396
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:41,855
Quinn's legwork may have shown me
where to find our friend,

397
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,690
but this, Benny -

398
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,985
my blood work is the stuff
that seals your fate.

399
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:49,445
(Music and chatter inside bar)

400
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,499
No security cameras.

401
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,502
Parks away from the lights.

402
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:08,256
You just come and go
as you please.

403
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:13,511
But as of tomorrow night,
those days are over.

404
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:25,023
I wasn't sure you'd actually come by.

405
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,737
Put in my face time with Masuka.

406
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,239
And then I came to where
I really wanted to be.

407
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,831
Tell me again this isn't crazy.

408
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,375
Yeah, it's crazy.

409
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:47,712
Crazy good.

410
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,474
(Both laughing)

411
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,649
Keep shooting.

412
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,901
He's so sweet
when he's sleeping.

413
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,032
We were all like that once.

414
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,992
Pure and innocent.

415
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:21,287
But then we grow up...

416
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,248
and things happen.

417
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,085
Well, nothing's going to happen.

418
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:30,463
Not when he has a great dad
watching over him.

419
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,548
Yeah, he's a lucky guy.

420
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:35,009
(♪ Loud pop music plays)

421
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:38,554
- (Sighs)
- (Harrison wails)

422
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,140
Astor!

423
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,977
- Mom!
- Turn that down.

424
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,937
We wouldn't have this problem
if you would just get me--

425
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:48,648
This is not how you go about
getting an iPod.

426
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,066
Now, since you woke your brother up,

427
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,443
you can walk him around the living room
until he falls asleep.

428
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,905
- But he never sleeps.
- Think about that next time.

429
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,453
There we go.

430
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,999
You'd like an iPod,
wouldn't you, little Harrison?

431
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,878
Why not just end the terror
and give her an iPod?

432
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:12,171
Mm-mm.

433
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:13,673
No, it's a power play.

434
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,259
She's trying to manipulate us
to get what she wants.

435
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:20,179
- That's not how it works in this family.
- Oh, right. Of course.

436
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,350
Cody. No more Marco Polo
in the mornings.

437
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,978
- But it's important.
- So is being ready for school.

438
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,689
When I grow up,
I want to be just like you.

439
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:32,025
Do what I want when I want.

440
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,609
You and me both.

441
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:35,320
And I want to be just like you.

442
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,572
(Growls) Marco!

443
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,032
Polo!

444
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,213
Great time last night, huh, Angel?

445
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:58,718
What?

446
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,179
You could've totally fucked
that stripper.

447
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,350
(Elevator dings)

448
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,144
Get to work, gentlemen.

449
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,273
What got into her?

450
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:32,585
What is this? Extreme Home Makeover:
Forensics Edition?

451
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:36,089
The first pass through, I found some blood
that didn't belong to the victim.

452
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,091
Possible DNA from the killer?

453
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,259
Don't think so.
The sample was pretty degraded.

454
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:41,469
Then what's the source?

455
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,596
Not sure. Yet.

456
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,432
Coming from you,
why does that not surprise me?

457
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,934
You know he's my brother, right?

458
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,894
Found something. Mr. Morgan.

459
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,020
Hmm?

460
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,233
It's blood.

461
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,114
Pool pattern, not incidental spatter
from the recent murder.

462
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,074
This is something else entirely.

463
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,201
Where's it from?

464
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,121
Bathtub.

465
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:11,582
So you're taking an already
extremely difficult case

466
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,960
and polluting it with your, what, theories?

467
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,671
- I didn't put the blood there.
- And according to you, neither did our killer.

468
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:20,466
Joey, why don't we step outside,
let the geeks get their geek on?

469
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:24,095
Look, I gotta be somewhere, so see if
you can hold things down around here

470
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,681
without going all asshole
on my brother, OK?

471
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,282
Blood tells. Blood always tells.

472
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,959
Dexter.

473
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,462
How's my favorite blood spatter analyst?

474
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,172
(Chuckles) Uh, great.

475
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,716
How's my favorite serial killer hunter?

476
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,969
Uh, you just missed Deb.

477
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:07,638
Actually, I'm here to see you.

478
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:08,806
Oh.

479
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,184
Database has a girl
killed here recently.

480
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,478
Severed femoral artery?

481
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:15,313
Pretty brutal.

482
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,901
Crime scene telling you anything?

483
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,819
Not much.

484
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,157
Killer was careful, right?

485
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,910
- Immaculate.
- Very.

486
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:34,332
Well, you're in the middle of
something here. I don't want to interrupt.

487
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,085
Mind if I drop by the station later?

488
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,588
Sure, not a problem.

489
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,800
Good seeing you again, Dexter.

490
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,849
Shit.

491
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:10,034
(Doorbell rings)

492
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,662
Hello, Detective.
Won't you come in?

493
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,999
I'm here to talk about Harry Morgan.

494
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,544
I'm his daughter, Debra.

495
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,671
Debra Morgan.

496
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,385
Handsome Harry Morgan.
How is he?

497
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,304
He died a while back.

498
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:35,518
Life does tend to suck.

499
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:39,230
Did you and my father have...

500
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,651
a good relationship?

501
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,737
Well...

502
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:52,034
Your father was a driven man.

503
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,079
He saw something he wanted,
nothing got in his way.

504
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:57,957
You're talking about women?

505
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,084
Women. Bad guys.

506
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,586
Anything.

507
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:03,921
Anyone.

508
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:09,218
Harry always said the only word
that wasn't in his vocabulary was "no".

509
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,973
- Did you say no to him?
- Dear.

510
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,392
I said yes.

511
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,146
All the time.

512
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,316
Shit, hundreds of times.

513
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,612
Only problem was...

514
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,075
Only problem was what?

515
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:39,624
I was saying yes to a question
he never asked.

516
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:43,794
So you didn't have an affair
with my father?

517
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:49,091
I don't know who you're looking for,
honey, but it ain't me.

518
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,687
Shut down for decades. Way out of town.

519
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,856
I'm liking this.

520
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,860
Broken-down boxer,
broken-down arena.

521
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:12,823
A fitting place for a punk like Benny Gomez
to go down for the count.

522
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,415
(Batista) Where you been?

523
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,043
Oh. Looking for misery.

524
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,879
- No upside to that.
- So I'm fucking learning.

525
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,425
That's all we got on the groom.
Plug was pulled 4:45 this morning.

526
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,302
- It's all yours.
- (Sighs)

527
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,889
A man's life and death,
reduced to a few...

528
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,015
What do you call 'em?

529
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,518
- Bytes.
- A few bytes. Just like that.

530
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:43,604
This economy, last thing
our city needs is dead tourists.

531
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,649
Hey, welcome to Miami.
Have a nice day.

532
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,693
Is that our tourist, Sergeant?

533
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:50,194
- It is, Lieutenant.
- OK.

534
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,406
The mayor's already given me an aneurysm
over this one, so make it a quick solve.

535
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:54,657
OK.

536
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:00,830
So whatever happened between you
and that Barbara Gianna from Vice?

537
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,790
We broke up.

538
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,667
Wanted different things.

539
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,461
Office romances.
Doomed before they fucking start.

540
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,839
- You mind if I ask her out?
- Knock yourself out.

541
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,323
The perfect husband wouId've
gotten rid of his old apartment.

542
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,075
But l kill people.

543
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,911
Not exactly the perfect husband.

544
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,044
Someone new is moving in.

545
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,548
Be nice.

546
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:46,143
The Iand that time
and Florida Electric forgot.

547
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,618
Look at this place.

548
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:05,079
All the cheering, all the triumph,

549
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:07,289
all the blood.

550
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,874
All for sport.

551
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,419
Until tonight.

552
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,205
(Music and chatter inside bar)

553
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,710
Keep at it, Benny,
and you'll be feeling no pain.

554
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,338
Better that way.

555
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,895
(Snoring)

556
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:23,282
Tell me you got a reason
for sleeping alone in your car

557
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,534
outside a bar
other than you're drunk.

558
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,120
I'm tired.

559
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,373
License and registration, please.

560
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:41,258
Sorry about this, Officer.
This is not what it looks like.

561
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,971
- You're with Homicide?
- Yes, sir.

562
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,266
Then you ought to know better.
Get out of the car, please.

563
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,482
You know your ABCs?

564
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,027
- Of course I do.
- Give me 'em backwards.

565
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:06,450
Uh...Z, Y, X, W...

566
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:11,246
V, U, T, S, R, Q,

567
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:16,502
- P, O, N, M, L, K...
- Clearly you're not drunk.

568
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:17,670
Yet.

569
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,464
- (Sighs)
- (Engine revving)

570
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:22,841
Damn it, Benny.

571
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:25,844
l can't go chasing after you
with a cop up my ass.

572
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:29,890
You got more important places
to be, Mr. Morgan.

573
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,395
(Sighs) Tell me about it.

574
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,363
Hey.

575
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,490
I thought you were working late.

576
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:50,202
- So did I.
- Mm.

577
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,704
Baby's down.

578
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,497
You know what that means?

579
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:56,250
- Mm. Sleep.
- Sex.

580
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:00,337
- Oh.
- And I'm not talking the rushed, frantic,

581
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,381
- the-kids-are-asleep sex.
- (Unzipping)

582
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:06,093
But slow, hot, steamy,
naughty sex.

583
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,679
Look, if you're too tired...

584
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,391
(Moans)

585
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:16,562
Dexter, ever since the move
and the baby,

586
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,231
- we've had, like, zero time together.
- Yeah.

587
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,151
I mean, aren't you
as horny as I am?

588
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:24,695
Course I am.

589
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:30,409
All right. Well, just close your eyes.

590
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,331
Maybe l can squeeze in a power nap.

591
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:37,916
OK, open.

592
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,796
Or not.

593
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:46,383
I was saving these for when we finally
got some real time alone.

594
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,844
And...

595
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,434
And tonight's the night.

596
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,061
Mm.

597
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:58,729
(She giggles)

598
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,147
Oh. Ha-ha...

599
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:01,899
(She giggles)

600
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:09,114
(Harrison cries)

601
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,742
- (Dexter) Oh...
- Mm.

602
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,577
It's all right. I'll go.

603
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,748
You've already done so much.

604
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,336
- (Crying)
- Oh, it's OK. Who's a good boy?

605
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,677
Yeah, who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

606
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,222
Yeah.

607
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,315
(Whispering) Want to know a secret?

608
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,695
Daddy kills people.

609
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,575
Well, bad people.

610
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:59,915
Not really anybody else
I can tell about that, you know?

611
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:10,134
Daddy's not going anywhere, buddy.

612
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:17,599
I've already lost my innocence.
I'm not going to sacrifice yours too.

613
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:34,199
- Triple red-eye, please.
- That's your third one today, bro.

614
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,494
You don't cut back,
you're tempting the heart gods.

615
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,621
Least of my worries.

616
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,540
Bro.

617
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,584
Brought you a copy of my article.

618
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,627
Figured you're a dumb cop
and don't read the paper.

619
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,255
Give me some credit.
I never miss the obituaries.

620
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:51,633
- Front page. Nice.
- I do what I can.

621
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,219
My editor OK'd a follow-up.
You got anything for me?

622
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,013
I would if I could, but I got nothing.

623
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,890
- Hmm.
- Besides, off the record,

624
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,267
we, uh, got bigger fish to fry.

625
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:02,019
What kind of fish?

626
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,938
Off the record.

627
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,608
You know those pricks who've been
shaking down tourists?

628
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:10,527
- The Vacation Robbers?
- No, the Vacation Murderers.

629
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,071
They shot some poor newlywed.
Didn't make it.

630
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:16,491
So...we're more than
a little distracted.

631
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:20,829
You want another distraction,
I'd love to take you out for a drink.

632
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:24,750
You know, to thank you
for your help...

633
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:28,420
- with the bathtub story.
- Uh-huh.

634
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,589
Uh-uh. I am so not hitting on you.

635
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,008
Yeah, me neither.
Let's make it dinner.

636
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,933
I got the blood work back
from our bathroom do-over.

637
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,976
- Did you run it through the database?
- No point.

638
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,270
The blood you swabbed
showed shit-all on the DNA front.

639
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,272
Our chances of finding out
who it belongs to

640
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,816
are about, oh,
one in six fucking billion.

641
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,112
What was Lisa Bell's address?

642
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,615
1578 Glencoe. Why?

643
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,158
Well...

644
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:02,120
if the DNA won't tell us who it
belonged to, maybe the address will.

645
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,122
(Masuka) 1578 Glencoe.

646
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,959
April 1 1th, 1979. Homicide.

647
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,752
1979?

648
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:14,800
(Dexter) Vicky Noonan, 22.

649
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,843
Found in the bathtub.

650
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,429
Bled out. Incision to her thigh.

651
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,807
What are the chances of that?

652
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:24,935
What are the chances of what?

653
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:26,561
Special Agent Lundy.

654
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:28,814
Vincent Masuka, if memory serves.

655
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:31,817
That's right.

656
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,194
LFI on the BHB.

657
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,363
- Heh.
- You're working a case, right?

658
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:39,366
- Feds need us to...
- Mind if I speak with Dexter?

659
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:43,829
Uh...I'll go, uh, to Records

660
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,081
and get the write-up on Noonan.

661
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,792
Just doing myjob.

662
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:57,050
- He's right, you know.
- About?

663
00:43:57,176 --> 00:44:00,137
Why I'm in Miami. It is a case.

664
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,681
Yeah, I figured.

665
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:06,101
But why do you need me?
You have the full resources of the FBI.

666
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,688
Not any more. I'm retired.

667
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:13,150
Oh. Their loss.

668
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,193
Yeah, well.

669
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,987
I fish. Travel.

670
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:19,156
And, uh...

671
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:22,659
now I have the time to track down
the one twisted son of a bitch who got away.

672
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:26,747
So who is the twisted son of a bitch?

673
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:29,499
I call him the Trinity Killer.

674
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:31,835
Kills in threes.

675
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:34,296
Been doing it all over
the country for years.

676
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:37,299
Problem is,
I can't prove he exists.

677
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:40,010
Law enforcement
doesn't talk to each other.

678
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:42,679
So no one at the FBI
is even on board.

679
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:45,223
Just me.

680
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,226
I've been looking for a break.
Then this happens.

681
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:49,644
Lisa Bell.

682
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:53,440
Her murder profile
fits the previous victims.

683
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,943
Trinity's in Miami, Dexter.

684
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,154
Starting his cycle all over again.

685
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,907
- (Water splashing)
- (Man, muffled) No... No...

686
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,117
No!

687
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:06,953
No...

688
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,081
How far back do your cases go?

689
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,999
About 15 years.

690
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:16,254
The house and room
where Lisa Bell was murdered

691
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:20,384
was the site of a very similar homicide
30 years ago.

692
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,094
Take a look.

693
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,055
- (Water splashing)
- (Man sobbing)

694
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:29,059
No... No...

695
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:32,896
We've come full circle.
He's back where his killing began.

696
00:45:33,523 --> 00:45:35,607
Whew. 30 years.

697
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,150
You know what this means?

698
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:42,447
Trinity's the most
successful serial killer to ever...

699
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,408
get away with it.

700
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:54,668
(Hissing)

701
00:45:58,131 --> 00:46:01,466
(Moaning)

702
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:05,679
(Screaming)

703
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:11,101
What? I'm fine.
I can't wait to see you.

704
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,066
Anton, I have to go.
I have a meeting.

705
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:23,738
Hello, Debra.

706
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,409
Motherfucking fuck.

707
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:29,619
(Chuckles)

708
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,663
Nice to see you too.

709
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,165
What are...

710
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,835
What... What are you doing here?

711
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:38,587
Are you here on a case?

712
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,965
Actually, I'm retired now.

713
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:45,302
Yet you're here.

714
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:49,931
Life has a natural forward momentum.
Certain things are inevitable.

715
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,935
Like you.

716
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:56,480
Making detective.

717
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:59,232
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

718
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,402
- I never had any doubt.
- (Chuckles)

719
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:08,116
So how long will your forward momentum
keep you in Miami?

720
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,619
Not sure exactly.

721
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,835
- Be seeing you.
- Yeah.

722
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,672
I guess. Maybe.
I mean, I don't... I don't know.

723
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:43,401
Big plans this evening, Sergeant?

724
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:45,487
The usual, Lieutenant.

725
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:48,532
(Elevator dings)

726
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,458
Oh.

727
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,585
- Hey, guys.
- (LaGuerta) Hey.

728
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,713
Drinks?

729
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:09,636
l had Benny Gomez on the ropes
and let him slip away.

730
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,429
No way l can go to that bar again.

731
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,057
Officer Alphabet made sure of that.

732
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:16,768
Which means l grab Benny
where he Iives.

733
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:19,479
A higher degree of difficulty,
but I don't have a choice.

734
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:23,483
lf l want to be around for my son,
l have to do this right.

735
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:26,194
l'm...killing for two now.

736
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:31,283
(Man speaking Spanish on TV)

737
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:53,888
- The fuck you want?
- You.

738
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:10,697
Look at him. Fast asleep.

739
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:12,616
Lucky guy.

740
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:19,873
(Sniffs)

741
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,516
I know you.

742
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:41,227
(Muffled)

743
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:43,730
I'm the blood guy.

744
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:07,170
You've made a lot of people
very miserable.

745
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:09,923
Me included.

746
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,720
Till now.

747
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,181
Oh...

748
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:23,978
Because now l get to answer
life's big question.

749
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:25,480
My life, anyway.

750
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:34,531
Can I do it? Can I have it all?

751
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:36,908
(Cell phone rings)

752
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,284
Oh, shit.

753
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:39,911
(Ringing continues)

754
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,041
Hello?

755
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,627
Dexter, I need you to go to
an all-night pharmacy right away.

756
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,587
I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

757
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:53,091
Well, Harrison has an ear infection.
He's in a lot of pain, Dexter.

758
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:54,676
Whatever you're doing can wait.

759
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,138
Uh, right. My mistake.
I wasn't thinking.

760
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:00,140
I'm on my way.

761
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:03,226
Kids.

762
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:12,110
Gotta go.

763
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,738
No time to savor this.

764
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:16,448
Clock's ticking.

765
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,116
But it's all about sacrifice.

766
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,410
- (Muffled scream)
- For the good of the family.

767
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:22,579
(Muffled scream)

768
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,142
Shit!

769
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:10,877
Maybe tonight wasn't perfect.

770
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:13,922
Maybe l need to reboot
the way l do things.

771
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,469
But at least l'm on the right road.

772
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:23,097
l'm on my way
to taking care of my family,

773
00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:24,474
raising my son.

774
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,643
And all the while
doing what l have to do

775
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:29,771
to satisfy a calling
that l can't ignore...

776
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:33,358
or deny.

777
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,653
l can do this.

778
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,493
Dexter!

779
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:47,622
You don't need to sleep!

780
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,002
You need to wake up!

780
00:52:54,305 --> 00:53:00,383
