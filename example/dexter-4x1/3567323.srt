- [roars]
- [shrieks]

167
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:05,833
- ah.

168
00:11:05,867 --> 00:11:07,501
Mm.
- take that!

169
00:11:07,535 --> 00:11:09,870
- carpools and swimming pools.

170
00:11:09,888 --> 00:11:13,057
How much
are we living the dream?

171
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:15,542
- so much.
- [laughs]

172
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:19,763
- living the dream.

173
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:22,850
- oh...

174
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:25,152
- [smooching]

175
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:26,770
Mm.

176
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:31,358
Hey, um, do you think you can
tivo jon stewart for me?

177
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:33,560
Mm.

178
00:11:33,578 --> 00:11:36,196
- thinking about
jon stewart, huh?

179
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,748
- [chuckles]

180
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:40,250
Well, he is handsome.

181
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:42,069
- [giggles]

182
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:43,537
- and funny.

183
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:44,788
- i love you.

184
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:52,713
Oh, fuck me.

185
00:11:52,747 --> 00:11:55,015
- that's kind of where this
is heading.

186
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,717
- no.
i'm late for work.

187
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:59,553
- [sighs]

188
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:07,094
It's a good thing you moved in,
or i'd never see you.

189
00:12:07,112 --> 00:12:09,429
- well, one of us
has to live here.

190
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:10,614
- at least
with the cruise ship,

191
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,116
I get to see you
every few days.

192
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,201
I went on tour...

193
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:15,235
- i know.

194
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:17,154
It's okay,
i kind of like it.

195
00:12:17,205 --> 00:12:18,288
Keeps you from getting sick
of me.

196
00:12:18,323 --> 00:12:20,457
- that's never going
to happen.

197
00:12:20,492 --> 00:12:21,992
- yeah, because
you're never here.

198
00:12:22,043 --> 00:12:25,829
- no, because
you make me happy.

199
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:32,302
- and what conclusions
did you draw

200
00:12:32,337 --> 00:12:33,804
From the blood evidence,
mr. morgan?

201
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:35,806
- i was able to determine

202
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,591
The victim's movement
and direction

203
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:40,427
After the initial
blunt force trauma to the head

204
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:42,262
Caused by the defendant's fist.

205
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:43,931
- how so?

206
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:48,936
- i...reconstructed, uh...

207
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,821
Timeline
and sequence of events

208
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:54,307
By examining...
it's here somewhere.

209
00:12:55,743 --> 00:12:58,478
I noticed a passive
flow pattern bloodstain

210
00:12:58,496 --> 00:13:01,281
Approximately
two meters in length

211
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:02,783
Emanating from
the head wound,

212
00:13:02,817 --> 00:13:04,651
And the sample was consistent

213
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:06,653
With the sample
from the defendant's shirt.

214
00:13:08,256 --> 00:13:10,791
- you did say "passive
flow pattern bloodstain"?

215
00:13:10,825 --> 00:13:12,843
- quote, unquote.

216
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:14,461
- what exactly
do your notes say?

217
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:16,680
- um...

218
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:21,051
"the bloodstain described
a passive pooling

219
00:13:21,102 --> 00:13:23,804
"and flow configuration,
type 'o' negative,

220
00:13:23,838 --> 00:13:27,057
"matching the sample taken
from, um...

221
00:13:27,108 --> 00:13:33,113
Uh...leonetti's shirt."

222
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:36,516
But this is the gomez hearing.

223
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:38,518
- yes, mr. morgan.

224
00:13:38,536 --> 00:13:40,654
The defendant's name
is benito gomez.

225
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:42,072
- [sighs]

226
00:13:42,123 --> 00:13:43,624
I must've brought
the wrong notes.

227
00:13:43,658 --> 00:13:46,326
- do you frequently become
confused and disoriented

228
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,195
When conducting your spatter
analysis, mr. morgan?

229
00:13:48,213 --> 00:13:49,663
- no, i do not.

230
00:13:49,697 --> 00:13:52,032
We...just had a new baby.

231
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,417
Things were a little hectic
this morning.

232
00:13:53,468 --> 00:13:55,085
- so you're saying
that you're sleep-deprived

233
00:13:55,136 --> 00:13:56,170
And it's affecting
your judgment?

234
00:13:56,204 --> 00:13:58,005
- no, it's just
a momentary mix-up.

235
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,390
- wrong notes,
wrong blood type.

236
00:14:00,425 --> 00:14:02,843
Wrong defendant.
wrong case.

237
00:14:02,877 --> 00:14:03,894
That's what you call

238
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:05,179
A momentary mix-up
in a murder trial?

239
00:14:05,213 --> 00:14:08,048
- i misspoke.

240
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:10,017
- oh, fuck.
- your honor, the witness

241
00:14:10,051 --> 00:14:11,268
Has just demonstrated
how unreliable he is

242
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:12,436
In a courtroom.

243
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:13,520
I would have to ask

244
00:14:13,554 --> 00:14:15,405
How reliable his work is
in the lab.

245
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,890
Or on a crime scene.

246
00:14:16,908 --> 00:14:19,493
Moreover, how reliable
is a police department

247
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:22,329
That would place so much trust
in his "expert" opinion?

248
00:14:31,172 --> 00:14:33,423
- i'm halfway through
the c.i. files you gave me.

249
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,792
- i were you,
i'd spend more time

250
00:14:35,843 --> 00:14:37,961
With that man of yours
and less time

251
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:39,963
Looking for some
old confidential informant

252
00:14:40,014 --> 00:14:42,082
Your daddy might've diddled
back in the day.

253
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,551
- i meet another one tomorrow.

254
00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:47,304
Maybe then i'll finally get
some answers.

255
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:48,855
- say you do.

256
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,090
Then what?

257
00:14:50,108 --> 00:14:54,194
- then...i'll know.

258
00:14:54,229 --> 00:14:58,565
That my perfect fucking father
wasn't so fucking perfect.

259
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:00,701
- so that's what,
the meaning of life?

260
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:03,737
- the meaning of my life.

261
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:10,277
- hey, buddy.

262
00:15:10,295 --> 00:15:11,995
Guess where i was yesterday.

263
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:14,614
- well, i'm not sure, i...

264
00:15:14,632 --> 00:15:15,749
- i was at a store.

265
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:17,251
Want to take a guess
what kind of store?

266
00:15:17,285 --> 00:15:19,052
- i don't know.
grocery?

267
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:21,838
- clothing. you know me,
i'm pretty into that shit.

268
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:23,674
Gotta come correct and all.
but not yesterday.

269
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:24,758
- look, if this is about--

270
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:26,059
- come on, buddy.
let me finish.

271
00:15:26,094 --> 00:15:27,644
I was at a store
helping a lady pick out

272
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:28,795
A suit for her son.

273
00:15:28,813 --> 00:15:30,847
Know why?
because he had to be in court.

274
00:15:30,898 --> 00:15:32,849
See the guy
who killed his old man.

275
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,651
Kid's first fucking suit.

276
00:15:34,686 --> 00:15:35,852
Something a father
should be doing.

277
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:37,521
- i'm sorry.
- little late for "sorry."

278
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:39,273
That asshole you let walk?

279
00:15:39,307 --> 00:15:40,691
- benito gomez.

280
00:15:40,742 --> 00:15:42,943
- ah, now you get it right.

281
00:15:42,977 --> 00:15:45,078
You actually see
what that fuckhead did?

282
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:48,031
Gomez hit the kid's old man
so hard,

283
00:15:48,082 --> 00:15:50,317
His cheekbone broke,
pushing his eyeball up

284
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:51,484
And out of his face.

285
00:15:51,502 --> 00:15:53,153
Then gomez,
sweetheart that he is,

286
00:15:53,171 --> 00:15:54,371
Kills the guy
in front of his own son.

287
00:15:54,422 --> 00:15:55,822
- i know.
- how about this beauty?

288
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,624
Gomez did five years
for beating his girlfriend

289
00:15:57,658 --> 00:15:59,659
So bad even her dentist
had a hard time with the i.d.

290
00:15:59,677 --> 00:16:01,595
So is your "sorry"
gonna keep gomez

291
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:03,380
From pounding somebody else
into the next world?

292
00:16:03,431 --> 00:16:05,048
- jesus, chill out, quinn.

293
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:07,834
- no, deb, he's right.
i screwed up in court today.

294
00:16:07,852 --> 00:16:09,502
Gomez walked.
this one's on me.

295
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,971
- thanks.
that means so much to me.

296
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:12,839
Why don't you hold onto those
for me, 'kay, buddy?

297
00:16:12,857 --> 00:16:14,674
I'm sick of looking at 'em.

298
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:16,176
- you screwed up?

299
00:16:16,194 --> 00:16:18,779
- big time.

300
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:20,513
- should i be worried?

301
00:16:20,531 --> 00:16:22,149
- [sighs]

302
00:16:22,183 --> 00:16:25,018
No, i'll be okay.

303
00:16:25,036 --> 00:16:28,155
Maybe it's benny gomez
who should be worried.

304
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:32,075
- and good solve
on the reynolds case, guys.

305
00:16:32,126 --> 00:16:35,195
Next up,
chief's office wants...

306
00:16:35,213 --> 00:16:37,197
- anything i can do to keep
that angry irish off your ass,

307
00:16:37,215 --> 00:16:38,332
Let me know.

308
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:40,917
- you're a real friend, vince.

309
00:16:40,968 --> 00:16:42,469
[deep breath]

310
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:44,087
Quinn's a good cop.

311
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:45,872
I need a good kill.

312
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,343
And sometimes one just falls
into your lap.

313
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:55,816
- we've got a body
in kendall.

314
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,150
Morgan, quinn, you're up.

315
00:16:57,185 --> 00:16:58,385
And dexter.
there's blood.

316
00:16:58,403 --> 00:16:59,603
Lots of blood.

317
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:09,946
- talk about your bloodbath.

318
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:13,116
[chuckles]

319
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:14,668
Tough room.

320
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:18,288
Okay, femoral artery severed.
she bled out in minutes.

321
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:20,573
- suicide?
- no weapon on the premises.

322
00:17:20,591 --> 00:17:22,959
- exactly. the coroner can suck
my uncircumcised dick

323
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,127
If he doesn't rule this
a homicide.

324
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:27,013
- that's way t.m.i.,
masuka.

325
00:17:27,048 --> 00:17:29,416
Employment records show she just

00:44:02,525 --> 00:44:04,309
I fish. travel.

820
00:44:04,343 --> 00:44:06,478
And, uh...

821
00:44:06,512 --> 00:44:07,946
Now i have the time
to track down

822
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:09,898
The one twisted
son of a bitch who got away.

823
00:44:09,949 --> 00:44:14,069
- so who is
the twisted son of a bitch?

824
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,738
- i call him
the trinity killer.

825
00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:19,157
Kills in threes.

826
00:44:19,191 --> 00:44:21,660
Been doing it all over
the country for years.

827
00:44:21,694 --> 00:44:24,696
Problem is,
i can't prove he exists.

828
00:44:24,714 --> 00:44:27,332
Law enforcement
doesn't talk to each other.

829
00:44:27,366 --> 00:44:29,885
So no one at the fbi
is even on board.

830
00:44:31,537 --> 00:44:32,554
Just me.

831
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:34,339
I've been looking for a break.

832
00:44:34,373 --> 00:44:35,841
Then this happens.

833
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:37,225
- lisa bell.

834
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,679
- her murder profile
fits the previous victims.

835
00:44:40,713 --> 00:44:44,266
Trinity's in miami, dexter.

836
00:44:44,317 --> 00:44:47,269
Starting his cycle
all over again.

837
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:51,556
- no...no...

838
00:44:51,574 --> 00:44:54,276
No...

839
00:44:54,327 --> 00:44:56,445
- how far back
do your cases go?

840
00:44:56,496 --> 00:44:58,246
- about 15 years.

841
00:44:58,281 --> 00:45:03,585
- the house and room
where lisa bell was murdered

842
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:05,704
Was the site
of a very similar homicide

843
00:45:05,738 --> 00:45:07,706
30 years ago.

844
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,407
Take a look.

845
00:45:09,425 --> 00:45:12,794
- [sobbing]

846
00:45:12,845 --> 00:45:16,264
No...no...

847
00:45:16,299 --> 00:45:18,416
- we've come full circle.

848
00:45:18,434 --> 00:45:20,102
He's back
where his killing began.

849
00:45:20,136 --> 00:45:22,921
30 years.

850
00:45:22,939 --> 00:45:24,389
You know what this means?

851
00:45:24,423 --> 00:45:28,360
- trinity's the most
successful serial killer

852
00:45:28,394 --> 00:45:30,028
To ever...

853
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:31,646
Get away with it.

854
00:45:46,996 --> 00:45:49,998
- [moaning]

855
00:45:55,388 --> 00:45:58,840
- what? i'm fine.
i can't wait to see you.

856
00:46:02,728 --> 00:46:05,296
Anton, i have to go.
i have a meeting.

857
00:46:09,301 --> 00:46:10,986
- hello, debra.

858
00:46:13,305 --> 00:46:15,524
- motherfucking fuck.

859
00:46:15,575 --> 00:46:16,942
- [chuckles]

860
00:46:16,976 --> 00:46:18,977
Nice to see you too.

861
00:46:18,995 --> 00:46:20,996
- what are...

862
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:24,649
What--
what are you doing here?

863
00:46:24,667 --> 00:46:25,834
Are you here on a case?

864
00:46:27,486 --> 00:46:29,204
- actually, i'm retired now.

865
00:46:29,255 --> 00:46:31,489
- yet you're here.

866
00:46:32,758 --> 00:46:35,160
- life has a natural
forward momentum.

867
00:46:35,178 --> 00:46:37,212
Certain things are inevitable.

868
00:46:39,048 --> 00:46:40,215
Like you.

869
00:46:42,101 --> 00:46:43,718
Making detective.

870
00:46:43,769 --> 00:46:45,520
Congratulations.

871
00:46:45,555 --> 00:46:46,555
- thanks.

872
00:46:46,606 --> 00:46:47,722
- i never had any doubt.

873
00:46:47,773 --> 00:46:49,674
- [small laugh]

874
00:46:51,694 --> 00:46:54,062
So how long
will your forward momentum

875
00:46:54,113 --> 00:46:55,346
Keep you in miami?

876
00:46:55,364 --> 00:46:57,866
- not sure exactly.

877
00:47:02,905 --> 00:47:03,989
Be seeing you.

878
00:47:04,023 --> 00:47:06,074
- yeah.

879
00:47:06,125 --> 00:47:08,160
I guess. maybe.

880
00:47:08,194 --> 00:47:09,878
I mean, i don't--
i don't know.

881
00:47:27,897 --> 00:47:30,815
- big plans this evening,
sergeant?

882
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:33,818
- the usual, lieutenant.

883
00:47:33,853 --> 00:47:35,770
[elevator dings]

884
00:47:44,697 --> 00:47:45,780
- oh.

885
00:47:45,831 --> 00:47:49,367
Hey, guys.

886
00:47:49,401 --> 00:47:50,902
Drinks?

887
00:47:53,756 --> 00:47:56,407
- i had benny gomez on the ropes
and let him slip away.

888
00:47:56,425 --> 00:47:58,877
No way i can go
to that bar again.

889
00:47:58,911 --> 00:48:01,379
Officer alphabet
made sure of that.

890
00:48:01,413 --> 00:48:03,598
Which means i grab benny
where he lives.

891
00:48:03,633 --> 00:48:06,718
A higher degree of difficulty,
but i don't have a choice.

892
00:48:06,752 --> 00:48:09,187
If i want to be around
for my son,

893
00:48:09,222 --> 00:48:10,588
I have to do this right.

894
00:48:10,606 --> 00:48:13,441
I'm...killing for two now.

895
00:48:15,761 --> 00:48:18,563
[man speaking spanish on tv]

896
00:48:38,084 --> 00:48:39,134
- the fuck you want?

897
00:48:39,168 --> 00:48:41,119
- you.

898
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:58,019
- look at him.
fast asleep.

899
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:59,821
Lucky guy.

900
00:49:23,763 --> 00:49:24,963
- i know you.

901
00:49:24,997 --> 00:49:28,466
[muffled]

902
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,002
- i'm the blood guy.

903
00:49:50,956 --> 00:49:54,409
You've made a lot of people
very miserable.

904
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,745
Me included.

905
00:49:59,715 --> 00:50:01,366
[exhales]

906
00:50:01,384 --> 00:50:02,867
Till now.

907
00:50:02,885 --> 00:50:05,754
Oh...

908
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:11,559
Because now i get to answer
life's big question.

909
00:50:11,594 --> 00:50:12,727
My life, anyway.

910
00:50:18,717 --> 00:50:21,736
Can i do it?
can i have it all?

911
00:50:21,771 --> 00:50:24,522
[cell phone rings]

912
00:50:24,556 --> 00:50:25,607
- oh, shit.

[phone ringing]

914
00:50:30,996 --> 00:50:32,397
Hello?

915
00:50:32,415 --> 00:50:34,949
- dexter, i need you to go to an
all-night pharmacy right away.

916
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,901
- i'm kind of
in the middle of something.

917
00:50:36,919 --> 00:50:38,536
- well, harrison has
an ear infection.

918
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:40,288
He's in a lot of pain,
dexter.

919
00:50:40,339 --> 00:50:41,923
Whatever you're doing can wait.

920
00:50:43,209 --> 00:50:45,460
- uh, right. my mistake.
i wasn't thinking.

921
00:50:45,511 --> 00:50:47,412
I'm on my way.

922
00:50:49,415 --> 00:50:50,432
Kids.

923
00:50:57,756 --> 00:50:59,858
Gotta go.

924
00:51:01,094 --> 00:51:02,778
Clock's ticking.

925
00:51:02,813 --> 00:51:04,480
But it's all about sacrifice.

926
00:51:04,531 --> 00:51:05,481
- [muffled scream]

927
00:51:05,532 --> 00:51:06,765
- for the good of the family.

928
00:51:06,783 --> 00:51:09,785
- [muffled scream]

929
00:51:55,532 --> 00:51:57,416
- maybe tonight wasn't perfect.

930
00:51:57,451 --> 00:52:00,169
Maybe i need to reboot
the way i do things.

931
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:05,708
But at least
i'm on the right road.

932
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:09,595
I'm on my way
to taking care of my family,

933
00:52:09,629 --> 00:52:10,796
Raising my son.

934
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:13,299
And all the while
doing what i have to do

935
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:16,001
To satisfy a calling
that i can't ignore...

936
00:52:18,271 --> 00:52:19,555
Or deny.

937
00:52:21,475 --> 00:52:22,942
I can do this.

938
00:52:28,114 --> 00:52:29,732
- dexter!

939
00:52:32,018 --> 00:52:33,852
You don't need to sleep!

You need to wake up!
